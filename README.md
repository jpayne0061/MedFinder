# MedFinder
This project is hosted: https://evan-payne.000webhostapp.com/medFinder/

This project was built to help nursing students quickly create medication lists for their patients.
Some of the staff found it helpful, too!

The data was scraped and wrangled using python. All the data is stored in the file system and retreived with ajax.
