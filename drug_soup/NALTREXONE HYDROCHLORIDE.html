<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>50 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Pure opioid antagonist with prolonged pharmacologic effect, structurally and pharmacologically similar to naloxone. Mechanism
         of action not clearly delineated, but it appears that its competitive binding at opioid receptor sites reduces euphoria and
         drug craving without supporting the addiction.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Weakens or completely and reversibly blocks the subjective effects (the "high") of IV opioids and analgesics possessing
         both agonist and antagonist activity.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjunct to the maintenance of an opioid-free state in detoxified addicts who are and desire to remain narcotic free. Management
         of alcohol dependence as an adjunct to social and psychotherapeutic methods.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Obesity.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Patients receiving opioid analgesics or in acute opioid withdrawal; opioid-dependent patient; acute hepatitis, liver failure.
         Also contraindicated in any individual who (1) fails naloxone challenge, (2) has a positive urine screen for opioids, or (3)
         has a history of sensitivity to naltrexone. Safety during pregnancy (category C), lactation, or in children

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Challenge Test</span><br/><p>Give the naloxone challenge test (administered IV of SC) before starting the abstinence program with naltrexone.</p>
<ul>
<li>SC dose: The SC dose is followed by an observation period of 45 min for symptoms of withdrawal (see below).</li>
<li>IV dose: A portion of the IV dose is injected and, with the needle left in place, the patient is observed for 30 sec for withdrawal
            symptoms. If none are observed, remainder of dose is injected and patient is observed for the next 20 min.
         </li>
<li>Withdrawal symptoms: Stuffiness or runny nose; tearing; yawning; sweating; tremors; vomiting; gooseflesh; feeling of temperature
            change; bone, joint, and muscle pains; abdominal cramps.
         </li>
<li>Interpretation: Evidence of withdrawal symptoms indicates that the patient is a potential risk and should not enter a naltrexone
            program.
         </li>
<li>Do not give naltrexone until patient is opiate free for at least 710 d.</li>

<li> 							Note: Naltrexone therapy may put you in danger of overdosing if you use opiates. Small doses even at frequent intervals will give
            no desired effects; however, a dose large enough to produce a high is dangerous and may be fatal. 						
         </li>
<li>It may be possible to transfer from methadone to naltrexone. This can be done after gradual withdrawal and final discontinuation
            of methadone.
         </li>
<li>Report promptly onset of signs of hepatic toxicity (see Appendix F) to physician. The drug will be discontinued.</li>
<li>Do not self-dose with OTC drugs for treatment of cough, colds, diarrhea, or analgesia. Many available preparations contain
            small doses of an opioid. Consult physician for safe drugs if they are needed.
         </li>
<li>Tell a doctor or dentist before treatment that you are using naltrexone.</li>
<li>Wear identification jewelry indicating naltrexone use.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
