<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>50 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Interferes with use of iodine and blocks synthesis of thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) and triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>). Does not interfere with release and utilization of stored thyroid hormone; thus antithyroid action is delayed days and
         weeks until preformed T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> are degraded.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Drug-induced hormone reduction results in compensatory release of thyrotropin (TSH), which causes marked hyperplasia and vascularization
         of thyroid gland. With good adherence to drug regimen, chemical euthyroidism can be achieved 612 wk after start of therapy.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Hyperthyroidism, iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis, and hyperthyroidism associated with thyroiditis; to establish euthyroidism
         prior to surgery or radioactive iodine treatment; palliative control of toxic nodular goiter.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Last trimester of pregnancy (category D), lactation; concurrent administration of sulfonamides or coal tar derivatives such
         as aminopyrine or antipyrine.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Infection; concomitant administration of anticoagulants or other drugs known to cause agranulocytosis; bone marrow depression;
         impaired liver function.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Give at the same time each day with relation to meals. Food may alter drug response by changing absorption rate.</li>
<li>If drug is being used to improve thyroid state before radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment, discontinued 3 or 4 d before treatment
            to prevent uptake interference. PTU therapy may be resumed if necessary 35 d after the RAI administration.
         </li>
<li>Store drug at 15°30° C (59°86° F) in light resistant container.</li>

<ul>
<li>Be aware that about 10% of patients with hyperthyroidism have leukopenia 3 and relative granulopenia.
         </li>
<li>Observe for signs of clinical response to PTU (usually within 2 or 3 wk): Significant weight gain, reduced pulse rate, reduced
            serum T<sub>4</sub>.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Baseline and periodic T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>; periodic CBC with differential and platelet count.
         </li>
<li>Satisfactory euthyroid state may be delayed for several months when thyroid gland is greatly enlarged.</li>
<li>Be alert to signs of hypoprothrombinemia: Ecchymoses, purpura, petechiae, unexplained bleeding. Warn ambulatory patients to
            report these signs promptly.
         </li>
<li>Be alert for important diagnostic signs of excess dosage: Contraction of a muscle bundle when pricked, mental depression,
            hard and nonpitting edema, and need for high thermostat setting and extra blankets in winter (cold intolerance).
         </li>
<li>Monitor for urticaria (occurs in 37% of patients during weeks 28 of treatment). Report severe rash.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Note that PTU treatment may be reinstituted if surgery fails to produce normal thyroid gland function.</li>
<li>Be aware that thyroid hormone may be given concomitantly with PTU throughout pregnancy to prevent hypothyroidism in mother
            with little effect on fetus.
         </li>
<li>Report severe skin rash or swelling of cervical lymph nodes. Therapy may be discontinued.</li>
<li>Report to physician sore throat, fever, and rash immediately (most apt to occur in first few months of treatment). Drug will
            be discontinued and hematologic studies initiated.
         </li>
<li>Avoid use of OTC drugs for asthma, or cough treatment without checking with the physician. Iodides sometimes included in such
            preparations are contraindicated.
         </li>
<li>Learn how to take pulse accurately and check daily. Report to physician continued tachycardia.</li>
<li>Report diarrhea, fever, irritability, listlessness, vomiting, weakness; these are signs of inadequate therapy or thyrotoxicosis.</li>
<li>Chart weight 2 or 3 times weekly; clinical response is monitored through changes in weight and pulse.</li>
<li>Continue monitoring and recording weight and pulse rate while in remission. Report onset of tremor, anxiety state, gradual
            ascending pulse rate, and loss of weight to physician (signs of hormone deficiency).
         </li>
<li>Do not alter drug regimen (e.g., increase, decrease, omit doses, change dosage intervals).</li>
<li>Check with physician about use of iodized salt and inclusion of seafood in the diet.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
