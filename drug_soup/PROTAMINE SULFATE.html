<p>10 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Purified mixture of simple, low-molecular-weight proteins obtained from sperm or testes of suitable fish species. Anticoagulant
         effect when used alone.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Because protamine is strongly basic, it combines with strongly acidic heparin to produce a stable complex; thus anticoagulant
         effect of both drugs is neutralized.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Antidote for heparin calcium or heparin sodium overdosage (after heparin has been discontinued).</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Antidote for heparin administration during extracorporeal circulation.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hemorrhage not induced by heparin overdosage; pregnancy (category C).</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Cardiovascular disease; history of allergy to fish; vasectomized or infertile males; lactation; patients who have received
         protamine-containing insulin.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1>
<p>
         			Note: Titrate dose carefully to prevent excess anticoagulation because protamine has a longer half-life than heparin and also has
         some anticoagulant effect of its own.

<ul>
<li>Do not use protamine if only minor bleeding occurs during heparin therapy because withdrawal of heparin will usually correct
            minor bleeding within a few hours.
         </li>
<li>Monitor BP and pulse q1530min, or more often if indicated. Continue for at least 23 h after each dose, or longer
            as dictated by patient's condition. Be prepared to treat patient for shock as well as hemorrhage.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Monitor effect of protamine in neutralizing heparin by aPTT or ACT values. Coagulation tests are usually performed
            515 min after administration of protamine, and again in 28 h if desirable.
         </li>
<li>Observe patients undergoing extracorporeal dialysis or patients who have had cardiac surgery carefully for bleeding (heparin
            rebound). Even with apparent adequate neutralization of heparin by protamine, bleeding may occur 30 min to 18 h after surgery.
            Monitor vital signs closely. Additional protamine may be required in these patients.
         </li>
