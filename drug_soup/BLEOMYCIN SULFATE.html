<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>15 units, 30 units powder for injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>A toxic drug with low therapeutic index; intensely cytotoxic. By unclear mechanism, blocks DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis.
         A cell cycle-phase nonspecific agent. Widely used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents because it lacks significant
         myelosuppressive activity.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>This mixture of cytotoxic antibiotics from a strain of <i>Streptomyces verticillus</i> has strong affinity for skin and lung tumor cells, in contrast to its low affinity for cells in hematopoietic tissue.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>As single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, as adjunct to surgery and radiation therapy. Squamous
         cell carcinomas of head, neck, penis, cervix, and vulva; lymphomas (including reticular cell sarcoma, lymphosarcoma, Hodgkin's);
         testicular carcinoma; malignant pleural effusions.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>
<i>Mycosis fungoides</i> and <i>Verruca vulgaris</i> (common warts).
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>History of hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to bleomycin; women of childbearing age, pregnancy (category D), lactation.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Compromised hepatic, renal, or pulmonary function; previous cytotoxic drug or radiation therapy.</p>

         			Note: Due to risk of anaphylactoid reaction, give lymphoma patients <img src="../images/special/lesserorequal.gif"/>2 U for first

<ul>
<li>Start with a test dose. Monitor patient closely for at least 24 h (vital signs, auscultation of chest, careful observations).
            If there is no acute reaction (hypotension, hyperpyrexia, chills, confusion, wheezing, cardiopulmonary collapse), start regular
            dosage schedule. Anaphylactoid reaction can be fatal (see Appendix F). It may occur immediately or several hours after first
            or second dose, especially in lymphoma patients (10%).
         </li>
<li>Therapeutic effectiveness: Favorable response, if any, is expected within 2 wk for treatment of Hodgkin's or testicular tumor,
            and within 3 wk for squamous cell cancers.
         </li>
<li>Monitor vital signs. Febrile reaction (mild chills and fever) is relatively common in patients receiving bleomycin therapy.
            It usually occurs within the first few hours after administration of a large single dose and lasts about 412 h. Reaction
            tends to become less frequent with continued drug administration, but can recur at any time.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for and report any of the following: Unexplained bleeding or bruising; evidence of deterioration of renal function
            (changed I&amp;O ratio and pattern, decreasing creatinine clearance, weight gain or edema); evidence of pulmonary toxicity (nonproductive
            cough, chest pain, dyspnea).
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Stomatitis can be a dose-limiting factor because oral ulcerations may interfere with adequate nutrient intake, leading to
            severe debilitation. Consult physician if an oral local anesthetic is indicated. Apply 10 min before meals to take effect
            so that patient can eat with less pain.
            						
         </li>
<li>Check weight at regular intervals under standard conditions. Weight loss and anorexia may persist a long time after therapy
            has been discontinued.
         </li>
<li>Report symptoms of skin toxicity (hypoesthesia, urticaria, tender swollen hands) promptly. May develop in second or third
            week of treatment and after 150200 U of bleomycin have been administered. Therapy may be discontinued.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid OTC drugs during antineoplastic treatment period unless approved by physician.</li>
<li>Report skin irritation which may not develop for several weeks after therapy begins.</li>
<li>Hyperpigmentation may occur in areas subject to friction and pressure, skin folds, nail cuticles, scars, and intramuscular
            sites.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
