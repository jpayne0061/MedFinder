<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>30 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Recombinant DNA monoclonal antibody that attaches to CD52 cell surface antigens expressed on a variety of leukocytes, including
         normal and malignant B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, and some granulocytes. Proposed mechanism of action is antibody-dependent
         lysis of leukemic cells following cell surface binding.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Initiates antibody dependent cell lysis, thus inhibiting cell proliferation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients who have failed fludarabine therapy.</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Treatment of mycosis fungoides, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Type I hypersensitivity to alemtuzumab or its components, hamster protein hypersensitivity; serious infection or exposure
         to viral infections (i.e., herpes or chickenpox), HIV infection, dental work; infection; pregnancy (category C), lactation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>History of hypersensitivity to other monoclonal antibodies; ischemic cardiac disease, angina, coronary artery disease; dental
         disease; history of varicella disease; females of childbearing age. Safety and efficacy in children are not established.

<ul>
<li>Monitor for acute infusion-related events, including hypotension, rigors, fever, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, chills,
            and/or rash. If such a reaction occurs, the infusion should be discontinued and the physician notified.
         </li>
<li>Withhold drug and notify physician if absolute neutrophil count 25,000/microliter.</li>
<li>Monitor BP closely during infusion period. Careful monitoring of BP and hypotensive symptoms is especially important in patients
            with ischemic heart disease and those on antihypertensives.
         </li>
<li>Discontinue infusion and notify physician immediately if any of the following occurs: hypotension, fever, chills, shortness
            of breath, bronchospasm, or rash.
         </li>
<li>Withhold drug during any serious infection. Therapy may be reinstituted following resolution of the infection.</li>
<li>Lab tests: CBS with differential and platelet counts weekly or more frequently in the presence of anemia, thrombocytopenia,
            or neutropenia; periodic blood glucose, serum electrolytes, and alkaline phosphatase.
         </li>
<li>Monitor diabetics closely for loss of glycemic control.</li>
<li>Monitor for S&amp;S of dehydration especially with severe vomiting.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not accept immunizations with live viral vaccines during therapy or if therapy has been recently terminated.</li>
<li>Use effective methods of contraception to prevent pregnancy during therapy and for at least 6 mo following therapy.</li>
<li>Report any of the following to physician immediately: Unexplained bleeding, fever, sore throat, flu-like symptoms, S&amp;S of
            an infection, difficulty breathing, significant GI distress, abdominal pain, fluid retention, or changes in mental status.
         </li>
<li>Diabetics should monitor blood glucose levels carefully since loss of glycemic control is a possible adverse reaction.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
