<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Perform C&amp;S and renal function prior to first dose and periodically during therapy; therapy may begin pending test
            results. Determine creatinine clearance and serum drug concentrations at frequent intervals, particularly for patients with
            impaired renal function, infants (renal immaturity), older adults, patients receiving high doses or therapy beyond 10 d, patients
            with fever or extensive burns, edema, obesity.
         </li>
<li>Repeat C&amp;S if improvement does not occur in 35 d; reevaluate therapy.</li>
<li>
            							Note: Dosages are generally adjusted to maintain peak serum gentamicin concentrations of 4 10 g/mL, and trough concentrations
            of 12 g/mL. Peak concentrations above 12 g/mL and trough concentrations above 2 g/mL are associated with toxicity.
            						
         </li>
<li>Draw blood specimens for peak serum gentamicin concentration 30 min1h after IM administration, and 30 min after completion
            of a 3060 min IV infusion. Draw blood specimens for trough levels just before the next IM or IV dose. Use nonheparinized
            tubes to collect blood.
         </li>
<li>Check baseline weight and vital signs; determine vestibular and auditory function before therapy and at regular intervals.
            Check vestibular and auditory function again 34 wk after drug is discontinued (the time that deafness is most likely
            to occur).
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O. Keep patient well hydrated to prevent chemical irritation of renal tubules. Report oliguria, unusual appearance
            of urine, change in I&amp;O ratio or pattern, and presence of edema (prolongs elimination time).
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Ototoxic effect (see Appendix F) is greatest on the vestibular branch of eighth cranial (acoustic) nerve (symptoms: headache,
            dizziness or vertigo, nausea and vomiting with motion, ataxia, nystagmus). However, damage to the auditory branch (tinnitus,
            roaring noises, sensation of fullness in ears, hearing impairment) may also occur. Report promptly to prevent permanent damage.
            						
         </li>
<li>Watch for S&amp;S of bacterial overgrowth (opportunistic infections) with resistant or nonsusceptible organisms (diarrhea, anogenital
            itching, vaginal discharge, stomatitis, glossitis).
         </li>

<li>
            							Note: When using topical applications: Avoid excessive exposure to sunlight because of danger of photosensitivity; withhold medication
            and notify physician if condition fails to improve within 1 wk, worsens, or signs of irritation or sensitivity occur; and
            apply medication as directed and only for length of time prescribed (overuse can result in superinfections).
