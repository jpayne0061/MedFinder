<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Interferon (IFN) alfa-2a, one of 4 types of alpha interferon, is a highly purified protein and natural product of human leukocytes
         within 46 h after viral stimulation. Also produced by recombinant DNA technology (rIFN-A). <b>
<i>Antiviral action:</i>
</b> Reprograms virus-infected cells to inhibit various stages of virus replication. <b>
<i>Antitumor action:</i>
</b> Suppresses cell proliferation. <b>
<i>Immunomodulating action:</i>
</b> Enhances phagocytic activity of macrophages and augments specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells. IFN is species
         specific but not virus specific; it partially inhibits viral replication and is immediately produced at site of viral entry
         by any cell; thus, the immune system and the interferon system of defense are complementary.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Has a broad spectrum of antiviral, cytotoxic, and immunomodulating activity (i.e., favorably adjusts immune system to better
         combat foreign invasion of antigens and viruses).
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>To induce hairy cell leukemia remission in splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients; treatment of hepatitis C, adjunct
         to surgery for malignant melanoma.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Chronic hepatitis B virus infection, solid tumors, human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated diseases, AIDS associated Kaposi's
         sarcoma.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to alpha interferons or any component of product and to mouse immunoglobulin. Safe use during pregnancy (category
         C), lactation, or by children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Cardiac disease or history of cardiac illness, severe cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease; seizure disorders, compromised CNS
         function; myelosuppression; chickenpox (existing or recent, including recent exposure), herpes zoster.
