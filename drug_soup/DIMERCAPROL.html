<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>100 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Dithiol compound that combines with ions of various heavy metals to form relatively stable, nontoxic, soluble complexes called
         chelates, which can be excreted; inhibition of enzymes by toxic metals is thus prevented. May also reactivate affected enzymes
         but is most effective when administered prior to enzyme damage.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Neutralizes the effects of various heavy metals.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Acute poisoning by arsenic, gold, and mercury; as adjunct to edetate calcium disodium (EDTA) in treatment of lead encephalopathy.</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Chromium dermatitis; ocular and dermatologic manifestations of arsenic poisoning, as adjunct to penicillamine to increase
         rate of copper excretion in Wilson's disease, and for poisoning with antimony, bismuth, chromium, copper, nickel, tungsten,
         zinc.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hepatic insufficiency (with exception of post-arsenical jaundice); severe renal insufficiency; poisoning due to cadmium, iron,
         selenium, or uranium; pregnancy (category D), lactation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Hypertension, patients with G6PD deficiency.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Intramuscular</span><br/><ul>
<li>Initiate therapy <small>ASAP</small> (within 12 h) after ingestion of the poison because irreversible tissue damage occurs quickly, particularly in mercury
            poisoning.
         </li>
<li>Give by deep IM injection only. Local pain, gluteal abscess, and skin sensitization possible. Rotate injection sites and observe
            daily.
         </li>
<li>Determine if a local anesthetic may be given with the injection to decrease injection site pain.</li>
<li>Handle with caution; contact of drug with skin may produce erythema, edema, dermatitis.</li>
<li> 					Note: Presence of sediment in ampul reportedly does not indicate drug deterioration. 				</li>

<ul>
<li>Monitor vital signs. Elevations of systolic and diastolic BPs accompanied by tachycardia frequently occur within a few minutes
            following injection and may remain elevated up to 2 h.
         </li>
<li> 								Note: Fever occurs in approximately 30% of children receiving treatment and may persist throughout therapy. 							</li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O. Drug is potentially nephrotoxic. Report oliguria or change in I&amp;O ratio to physician.</li>
<li>Keep urine alkaline to reduce possibility of renal damage during elimination of dimercaprol chelate.</li>
<li>Check urine daily for albumin, blood, casts, and pH. Blood and urinary levels of the metal serve as guides for dosage adjustments.</li>
<li>Minor adverse reactions generally reach maximum 1520 min after drug administration and subside in 3090 min. Ephedrine
            or an antihistamine is sometimes administered to prevent symptoms.
         </li>
