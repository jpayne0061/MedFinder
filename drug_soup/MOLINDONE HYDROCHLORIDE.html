<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Tranquilizer structurally unrelated but pharmacologically similar to the piperazine phenothiazines; thought to block postsynaptic
         dopamine receptors in the brain. Has less sedative but comparable anticholinergic activity and greater incidence of extrapyramidal
         adverse effects than chlorpromazine. EEG studies suggest ascending reticular system is chief site of action.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Reportedly lowers convulsive threshold and produces tranquilization without compromising alertness. Antipsychotic effect includes
         reduction in bizarre behavior, and control of aggressiveness.
