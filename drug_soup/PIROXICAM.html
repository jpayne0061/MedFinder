<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>10 mg, 20 mg capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent. Exact mechanism of action unclear. Strongly inhibits enzyme cyclooxygenase, biogenic
         catalyst of prostaglandin synthesis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Drug-induced reduction in prostaglandin levels is associated with decreased inflammatory processes in bone-joint disease,
         and with possible interference with platelet aggregation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Acute and long-term relief of mild to moderate pain and for symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Acute and chronic relief of mild to moderate pain.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hemophilia; syndrome (bronchospasm, nasal polyps, angioedema) precipitated by aspirin or other NSAID; active peptic ulcer,
         GI bleeding. Safety in children, during pregnancy (category C), or lactation is not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>History of upper GI disease including ulcerative colitis; kidney dysfunction; compromised cardiac function; hypertension or
         other conditions predisposing to fluid retention; coagulation disorders.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Wait at least 7 d to evaluate antirheumatic effect.</li>
<li>Clinical evidence of benefits from drug therapy include pain relief in motion and in rest, reduction in night pain, stiffness,
            and swelling; increased ROM (range of motion) in all joints.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that adverse effects may not appear for 710 d after start of therapy (except for an allergic reaction).</li>
<li>Lab tests: Periodic BUN, ALT, AST, CBC, Hgb and Hct in patient (especially the older adult) receiving drug for an extended
            period.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>If a dose is missed, take drug when missed dose is discovered if it is 68 h before the next scheduled dose. Otherwise,
            omit dose and reestablish regimen at next scheduled hour.
         </li>
<li>Do not self-dose with aspirin or other OTC drug without physician's advice.</li>
<li>Do not increase dosage beyond prescribed regimen. Understand that long half-life of drug may cause delayed therapeutic effect.
            Higher than recommended doses are associated with increased incidence of GI irritation and peptic ulcer.
         </li>
<li>Incidence of GI bleeding with this drug is relatively high. Report symptoms of GI bleeding (e.g., dark, tarry stools, coffee-colored
            emesis) or severe gastric pain promptly to physician.
         </li>
<li>Be alert to symptoms of drug-induced anemia: Profound fatigue, skin and mucous membrane pallor, lethargy.</li>
<li>Avoid alcohol since it may increase the risk of GI bleeding.</li>
<li>Be alert to signs of hypoprothrombinemia including bruises, pinpoint rash, unexplained bleeding, nose bleed, blood in urine,
            when piroxicam is taken concomitantly with an anticoagulant.
         </li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in potentially hazardous activities until response to drug is known.</li>
<li>Drink at least 68 full glasses of water daily and report signs of renal insufficiency (see Appendix F) to physician
            because most of drug is excreted by kidneys and impaired kidney function increases danger of toxicity.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
