<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>100 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg tablets and capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Drug is a metabolic precursor of dopamine, a catecholamine neurotransmitter. Unlike dopamine, levodopa readily crosses the
         bloodbrain barrier. Precise mechanism of action unknown.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Levodopa restores dopamine levels in extrapyramidal centers (believed to be depleted in parkinsonism).</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Idiopathic Parkinson's disease, postencephalitic and arteriosclerotic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism symptoms associated with
         manganese and carbon monoxide poisoning.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>To relieve pain of herpes zoster (shingles), liver coma (caused by cirrhosis or fulminating hepatitis), bone pain in metastatic
         breast carcinoma, adjunctive therapy in CHF.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Known hypersensitivity to levodopa; narrow-angle glaucoma patients with suspicious pigmented lesion or history of melanoma;
         acute psychoses, severe psychoneurosis, within 2 wk of use of <small>MAO INHIBITORS</small>. Safe use during pregnancy (category C), lactation, or in children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Cardiovascular, kidney, liver, or endocrine disease, history of MI with residual arrhythmias; peptic ulcer; convulsions: psychiatric
         disorders; chronic wide-angle glaucoma; diabetes; pulmonary diseases, bronchial asthma; patients receiving antihypertensive
         drugs.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor vital signs, particularly during period of dosage adjustment. Report alterations in BP, pulse, and respiratory rate
            and rhythm.
         </li>
<li>Supervise ambulation as indicated. Orthostatic hypotension is usually asymptomatic, but some patients experience dizziness
            and syncope. Tolerance to this effect usually develops within a few months of therapy.
         </li>
<li>Make accurate observations and report adverse reactions and therapeutic effects promptly. Rate of dosage increase is determined
            primarily by patient's tolerance and response to drug.
         </li>
<li>Monitor all patients closely for behavior changes.</li>
<li>Monitor patients with chronic wide-angle glaucoma for changes in intraocular pressure.</li>
<li>Monitor diabetics for loss of glycemic control.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Monitor blood glucose &amp; HbA<sub>1c</sub>, CBC, Hgb and Hct, serum potassium, and liver &amp; kidney function periodically.
         </li>
<li>Report promptly muscle twitching and spasmodic winking (blepharospasm); these are early signs of overdosage. Patients on full
            therapeutic doses for &gt;1 y may develop such abnormal involuntary movements as well as jerky arm and leg movements. Symptoms
            tend to increase if dosage is not reduced.
         </li>
<li>Report to physician any S&amp;S of the onoff phenomenon sometimes associated with chronic management: Rapid unpredictable
            swings in intensity of motor symptoms of parkinsonism evidenced by increase in bradykinesia (attacks of "leg freezing"
            or slow body movement).
         </li>
<li>Monitor mental status for S&amp;S of drug-induced neuropsychiatric adverse reactions.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not take with high-protein foods. Also avoid high consumption of food sources of pyridoxine, including wheat germ, green
            vegetables, banana, whole-grain cereals, muscular and glandular meats (especially liver), legumes. Learn good dietary practices.
         </li>
<li>Do not take OTC preparations or fortified cereals unless approved by physician. Multivitamins, antinauseants, and fortified
            cereals usually contain vitamin B<sub>6</sub>.
         </li>
<li>Make positional changes slowly, particularly from lying to upright position, and dangle legs a few minutes before standing.</li>
<li>Resume activities gradually, observing safety precautions to avoid injury. Elevation of mood and sense of well-being may precede
            objective improvement. Significant improvement usually occurs during second or third week of therapy, but may not occur for
            6 mo or more in some patients.
         </li>
<li>Follow prescribed drug regimen. Sudden withdrawal of medication can lead to parkinsonism crisis (with return of marked rigidity,
            akinesia, tremor, hyperpyrexia) or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).
         </li>
<li>A metabolite of levodopa may cause urine to darken and sweat to be dark-colored.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
