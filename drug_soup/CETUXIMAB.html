<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Cetuximab is a recombinant, monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, HER1,
         c-ErbB-1) on both normal and tumor cells. Binding to the EGFR results in inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis,
         and decreased vascular endothelial growth factor production.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Overexpression of EGFR is detected in many human cancers, including those of the colon and rectum. Cetuximab inhibits the
         growth and survival of tumor cells that overexpress the EGFR.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Treatment of EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with irinotecan in patients who are refractory to
         irinotecan-based chemotherapy or as monotherapy in patients who are intolerant to irinotecan-based chemotherapy.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Pregnancy (category C), lactation within 60 d of using cetuximab. Safety and efficacy in children have not been established.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Infusion reaction, especially with first time users; history of hypersensitivity to murine proteins or cetuximab; pulmonary
         disease, pulmonary fibrosis; UV exposure, radiation therapy.

<li>Administer with full resuscitation equipment available and under the supervision of a physician experienced with chemotherapy.</li>
<li>Premedication with an H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonist (e.g., diphenhydramine 50 mg IV) is recommended.
                  </li>
<li>Monitor for an infusion reaction for at least 1 h following completion of infusion.</li>

<p><span class="routemethod">PREPARE:</span> <span class="methodtype"> IV Infusion:</span>  Do not shake or further dilute vial. Do not mix with other medication. Inject cetuximab solution into a sterile, evacuated
                  container or bag (i.e., glass, polyolefin, ethylene vinyl acetate, DEHP plasticized PVC, or PVC); repeat until needed dose
                  has been added to container, using a new needle for each vial. Attach to infusion set with a low-protein-binding 0.22-micron
                  filter and prime line with cetuximab. May also administer by syringe and syringe pump; use a new needle and filter for each
