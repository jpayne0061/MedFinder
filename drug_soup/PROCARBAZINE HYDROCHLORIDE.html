<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>50 mg capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Hydrazine derivative with antimetabolite properties; cell cycle-specific for the S phase of cell division. Precise mechanism
         of action unknown. Suppresses mitosis at interphase, and causes chromatin derangement.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Highly toxic to rapidly proliferating tissue. Has immunosuppressive properties and exhibits MAO inhibition activity. May delay
         myelosuppression. Reportedly does not affect survival time but may produce remissions of at least 1 mo duration.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjunct in palliative treatment of Hodgkin's disease.</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Solid tumors.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Myelosuppression; alcohol ingestion; foods high in tyramine content; sympathomimetic drugs. MAO inhibitors should be discontinued
         14 d prior to therapy; tricyclic antidepressants, 7 d before therapy. Safety during pregnancy (category D) or lactation is
         not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Concomitant administration with CNS depressants; hepatic or renal impairment; following radiation or chemotherapy before at
         least 1 mo has elapsed; hepatic and renal impairment; infection; diabetes mellitus.

<ul>
<li>Start flow sheet and record baseline BP, weight, temperature, pulse, and I&amp;O ratio and pattern.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Determine hematologic status (Hgb, Hct, WBC, differential, reticulocyte, and platelet counts) initially and at
            least q34d. Hepatic and renal studies (transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, BUN, urinalysis) are also indicated initially
            and at least weekly during therapy.
         </li>
<li>Protect patient from exposure to infection and trauma when nadir of leukopenia (3) is approached. Note and report changes in voiding pattern, hematuria, and dysuria (possible signs of urinary tract infection).
            Monitor I&amp;O ratio and temperature closely.
         </li>
<li>Withhold drug and notify physician of any of the following: CNS S&amp;S (e.g., paresthesias, neuropathies, confusion); leukopenia
            (WBC count 3; thrombocytopenia (platelet count 3); hypersensitivity reaction, the first small ulceration or persistent spot of soreness in oral cavity, diarrhea, and bleeding.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for and report any of the following: chills, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, productive cough. Drug will be
            discontinued.
         </li>
<li>Assess for signs of liver dysfunction: Jaundice (yellow skin, sclerae, and soft palate), frothy or dark urine, clay-colored
            stools.
         </li>
<li>Tolerance to nausea and vomiting (most common adverse effects) usually develops by end of first week of treatment. Doses are
            kept at a minimum during this time. If vomiting persists, therapy will be interrupted.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid OTC nose drops, cough medicines, and antiobesity preparations containing sympathomimetic drugs (e.g., ephedrine, amphetamine,
            epinephrine) and tricyclic antidepressants because they may cause hypertensive crises since procarbazine has MAO inhibitory
            activity. Do not to use OTC preparations without physician's approval.
         </li>
<li>Report to physician any sign of impending infection.</li>
<li>Do not eat foods high in tyramine content (e.g., aged cheese, beer, wine).</li>
<li>Avoid alcohol; ingestion of any form of alcohol may precipitate a disulfiram-type reaction (see Appendix F).</li>
<li>Report to physician immediately signs of hemorrhagic tendencies: Bleeding into skin and mucosa, epistaxis, hemoptysis, hematemesis,
            hematuria, melena, ecchymoses, petechiae. Bone marrow depression often occurs 28 wk after start of therapy.
         </li>
<li>Avoid excessive exposure to the sun because of potential photosensitivity reaction: Cover as much skin area as possible with
            clothing, and use sunscreen lotion (SPF &gt;12) on all exposed skin surfaces.
         </li>
<li>Use caution while driving or performing hazardous tasks until response to drug is known since drowsiness, dizziness, and blurred
            vision are possible adverse effects.
         </li>
<li>Use contraceptive measures during procarbazine therapy.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
