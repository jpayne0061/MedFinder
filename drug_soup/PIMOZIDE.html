<p>2 mg tablet</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Potent central dopamine antagonist that alters release and turnover of central dopamine stores; has no effect on turnover
         of norepinephrine.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Blockade of CNS dopaminergic receptors results in suppression of the motor and phonic tics that characterize Tourette's disorder.
         Produces less sedation and fewer extrapyramidal reactions than haloperidol; lowers seizure threshold.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>To suppress severe motor and phonic tics in patient with Tourette's disorder who has failed to respond satisfactorily to standard
         treatment (e.g., haloperidol).
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Treatment of simple tics other than those associated with Tourette's disorder; drug-induced tics; history of cardiac dysrhythmias
         and conditions marked by prolonged QT syndrome, patient taking drugs that may prolong QT interval (e.g., quinidine); severe
         toxic CNS depression. Safety in children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Kidney and liver dysfunction; patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Increase drug dose gradually, usually over 13 wk, until maintenance dose is reached.</li>
<li>Follow regimen prescribed by physician for withdrawal: Usually slow, gradual changes over a period of days or weeks (drug
            has a long half-life). Sudden withdrawal may cause reemergence of original symptoms (motor and phonic tics) and of neuromuscular
            adverse effects of the drug.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain ECG baseline data at beginning of therapy and check periodically, especially during dosage adjustments.</li>
<li>Notify physician immediately for widening or prolongation of the QT interval, which suggests developing cardiotoxicity [QT
            interval (QRS complex and T wave) representing both ventricular depolarization and repolarization].
         </li>
<li>Risk of tardive dyskinesia appears to be greatest in women, older adults, and those on high-dose therapy.</li>
<li>Be aware that extrapyramidal reactions often appear within the first few days of therapy, are dose-related, and usually occur
            when dose is high.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, constipation) may increase as dose is increased.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Adhere to established drug regimen (i.e., do not change dose or intervals and discontinue only with physician's guidance).</li>
<li>Use measures to relieve dry mouth (frequent rinsing with water, saliva substitute, increased fluid intake) and constipation
            (increased dietary fiber, drink 68 glasses of water daily).
         </li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in potentially hazardous activities because drug-caused hand tremors, drowsiness, and blurred vision
            may impair alertness and abilities.
         </li>
<li>Pseudoparkinsonism symptoms are usually mild and reversible with dose adjustment.</li>
<li>Be alert to the earliest symptom of tardive dyskinesia ("flycatching"an involuntary movement of the tongue),
            and report promptly to the physician.
         </li>
<li>Return to physician for periodic assessments of therapy benefit and cardiac status.</li>
<li>Understand dangers of ingesting alcohol to prevent augmenting CNS depressant effects of pimozide.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
