<p>20% solution</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Hypertonic saline instillation into the amniotic sac induces abortion and fetal death. Mechanism is unclear, but abortifacient
         activity may be a response to prostaglandins released by hypertonic NaCl-damaged decidual cells.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Uterine contractions induced by the saline solution are sufficient to cause evacuation of fetus and placenta; however, in
         2540% of the patients, abortion may be incomplete.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>To induce abortion late in the second trimester of pregnancy. Oxytocin may be used as an adjunct (concurrent) uterine stimulant.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Pregnancy (category X) of less than 15 wk or more than 24 wk; prior uterine surgery (including cervix), pelvic adhesions;
         sickle cell disease, diabetes mellitus; increased intraamniotic pressure (as in contracting or hypertonic uterus); poor health,
         blood disorders, coagulation factor deficiencies.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Malignant hypertension, cardiovascular and kidney disease, thrombocytopenia, fibrinolytic defects.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Instillation</span><br/><ul>
<li>Prepare skin as for surgery prior to procedure. Withdraw about 1 mL of amniotic fluid by transabdominal tap to confirm location
            of needle (amniotic fluid has pH 7.4 and ability to fern). If blood is present or if no amniotic fluid is withdrawn, needle
            is repositioned. Some clinicians then remove all amniotic fluid (30250 mL); others wait until NaCl instillation.
         </li>
<li>Instill NaCl through 3-way stopcock with needle and polyethylene catheter inserted into amniotic cavity.</li>
<li>Administer IV infusion of dilute solution of oxytocin within 12 h after hypertonic solution instillation and after uterine
            response to the solution has ceased at rate, 20100 mU/min. Oxytocin action as an adjunctive uterine stimulant shortens
            the abortifacient-abortion interval.
         </li>
<li>Be prepared to treat extraamniotic injection: Stop procedure promptly. Start IV infusion of D5W; additional support for hypernatremic
            shock.
         </li>

<ul>
<li>Observe patient for at least 30 min after instillation procedure. Be available for complaints and to check vital signs: temperature,
            pulse rate, BP.
         </li>
<li> 							Note: Intraamniotic instillation is a painless procedure. No anesthetic or sedative is needed or given so that patient is able to
            report early signs of extraamniotic injection including mental confusion, hypotension, severe headache, vague distress, extreme
            nervousness, pain, sensation of heat, thirst, fingertip numbness, dry mouth, salty taste, tinnitus. 						
         </li>
<li>Suspect accidental intraperitoneal, intravascular, or myometrial injection if patient begins vomiting. Cardiovascular collapse,
            seizures, and maternal death may follow.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Drink at least 2 L water on day of procedure to promote NaCl excretion.</li>
<li>Return promptly to treatment center with onset of labor, signs of rupture of fetal membrane, vaginal bleeding, fever, or any
            other untoward symptom.
         </li>
<li>Return to physician for evaluation and treatment if labor has not begun within 48 h of hypertonic saline instillation.</li>
