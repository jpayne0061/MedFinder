<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>10% solution in D5W or NS</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Low-molecular-weight polysaccharide. As a hypertonic colloidal solution, produces immediate and short-lived expansion of plasma
         volume by increasing colloidal osmotic pressure and drawing fluid from interstitial to intravascular space. Reduces possibility
         of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, primarily by inhibiting venous stasis and platelet adhesiveness.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Cardiovascular response to volume expansion includes increased BP, pulse pressure, CVP, cardiac output, venous return to heart,
         and urinary output.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjunctively to expand plasma volume and provide fluid replacement in treatment of shock or impending shock caused by hemorrhage,
         burns, surgery, or other trauma. Also used in prophylaxis and therapy of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Used as
         priming fluid or as additive to other primers during extracorporeal circulation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to dextrans, renal failure, hypervolemic conditions, severe CHF, thrombocytopenia, significant anemia, hypofibrinogenemia
         or other marked hemostatic defects including those caused by drugs, (e.g., heparin, warfarin); pregnancy (category C), lactation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Active hemorrhage; severe dehydration; chronic liver disease; impaired renal function; patients susceptible to pulmonary edema
         or CHF.

<ul>
<li>Evaluate patient's state of hydration before dextran therapy begins. Administration to severely dehydrated patients can result
            in renal failure.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Baseline Hct prior to and after initiation of dextran (dextran usually lowers Hct). Notify physician if Hct is
            depressed below 30% by volume.
         </li>
<li>Monitor vital signs and observe patient closely for at least the first 30 min of infusion. Hypersensitivity reaction is most
            likely to occur during the first few minutes of administration. Terminate therapy at the first sign of a hypersensitivity
            reaction (see Appendix F).
         </li>
<li>Monitor CVP as an estimate of blood volume status and a guide for determining dosage. Normal CVP: 510 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.
         </li>
<li>Observe for S&amp;S of circulatory overload (see Appendix F).</li>
<li> 								Note: When sodium restriction is indicated, know that 500 mL of dextran 40 in 0.9% normal saline contains 77 mEq of both sodium
            and chloride. 							
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O ratio and check urine specific gravity at regular intervals. Low urine specific gravity may signify failure of
            renal dextran clearance and is an indication to discontinue therapy.
         </li>
<li>Report oliguria, anuria, or lack of improvement in urinary output (dextran usually causes an increase in urinary output).
            Discontinue dextran at first sign of renal dysfunction.
         </li>
<li>High doses are associated with transient prolongation of bleeding time and interference with normal blood coagulation.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report immediately S&amp;S of bleeding: easy bruising, blood in urine or dark tarry stool.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
