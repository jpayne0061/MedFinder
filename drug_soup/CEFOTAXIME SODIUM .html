<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>500 mg, 1 g, 2 g injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Broad-spectrum semi-synthetic third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. Preferentially binds to one or more of the penicillin-binding
         proteins (PBP) located on cell walls of susceptible organisms. This inhibits third and final stage of bacterial cell wall
         synthesis, thus killing the bacteria.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Generally active against a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria including most of the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>. Also active against some organisms resistant to first and second generation cephalosporins and currently available aminoglycoside
         antibiotics and penicillins. Used in the treatment of gram-negative adult bacillary meningitis, neonatal and childhood meningitis,
         and <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>. Effectively treats bone and joint infections, CNS infections, gynecologic infections and gonorrhea, lower respiratory tract
         infections, intra-abdominal infections, skin and urinary tract infections, and is used for surgical prophylaxis to reduce
         or eliminate infection.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Serious infections of lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures, bones and joints, CNS (including meningitis and ventriculitis),
         gynecologic and GU tract infections, including uncomplicated gonococcal infections caused by penicillinase-producing <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> (PPNG). Also used to treat bacteremia or septicemia, intra-abdominal infections, and for perioperative prophylaxis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Currently recommended by CDC for treatment of disseminated gonococcal infections (gonococcal arthritis-dermatitis syndrome)
         and as drug of choice for gonococcal ophthalmia caused by PPNG in adults, children, and neonates.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins and other beta-lactam antibiotics; pregnancy (category B).</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>History of type I hypersensitivity reactions to penicillin; history of allergy to other beta-lactam; antibiotics; renal impairment;
         history of colitis or other GI disease; lactation.

<li>Add 3 mL sterile water for injection or bacteriostatic water for injection to vial containing 1 g drug, providing a solution
            of approximately 300 mg cefotaxime/mL.
         </li>
<li>Administer IM injection deeply into large muscle mass (e.g., upper outer quadrant of gluteus maximus). Aspirate to avoid inadvertent
            injection into blood vessel. If IM dose is 2 g, divide dose and administer into 2 different sites.

<ul>
<li>Determine previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins and penicillins, and history of other allergies, particularly
            to drugs, before therapy is initiated.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Perform culture and sensitivity tests before initiation of therapy and periodically during therapy if indicated.
            Therapy may be instituted pending test results. Serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, BUN should be evaluated at regular
            intervals during therapy and for several months after drug has been discontinued. Perform periodic hematologic studies (including
            PT and PTT) and evaluation of hepatic functions with high doses or prolonged therapy.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O rates and patterns: Report change in I&amp;O in patients with impaired renal function or with chronic UTI or who are
            receiving high dosages or an aminoglycoside concomitantly.
         </li>
<li>Superinfection due to overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms may occur, particularly with prolonged therapy.</li>
<li>Report onset of diarrhea promptly. Check for fever. If diarrhea is mild, discontinuation of cefotaxime may be sufficient.</li>
<li>If diarrhea is severe, suspect antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis, a life-threatening superinfection (may occur
            in 49 d or as long as 6 wk after cephalosporin therapy is discontinued). Chronically ill or debilitated older adult
            patients undergoing abdominal surgery or those in an intensive care unit are most vulnerable.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report any early signs or symptoms of superinfection promptly. Superinfections caused by overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms
            may occur, particularly during prolonged use.
         </li>
<li>Yogurt or buttermilk, 120 mL (4 oz) of either (if allowed), may serve as a prophylactic against intestinal superinfection
            by helping to maintain normal intestinal flora.
         </li>
<li>Report loose stools or diarrhea.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
