<p>5 mg, 10 mg tablets; 5 mg, 10 mg sustained release tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Second generation sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent. Potency is enhanced by as much as 200-fold over first generation agents.</p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Directly stimulates functioning pancreatic beta cells to secrete insulin, leading to an acute drop in blood glucose. Indirect
         action leads to altered numbers and sensitivity of peripheral insulin receptors, resulting in increased insulin binding. It
         also causes inhibition of hepatic glucose production and reduction in serum glucagon levels.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjunct to diet for control of hyperglycemia in patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus after dietary control alone has failed;
         also used to treat transient loss of control in patient usually controlled well on diet.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Diabetic ketoacidosis. Safe use during pregnancy (category C), lactation, or in children is not established.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Impaired renal and hepatic function; older adults; debilitated, malnourished patients; patients with adrenal or pituitary
         insufficiency.

<ul>
<li>Observe response to the initial dose and establish maintenance regimen cautiously in older adult or debilitated patients;
            early signs of hypoglycemia are easily overlooked.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: monitor periodically during long-term therapy: Liver function tests, serum electrolytes, and serum osmolarity.</li>
<li> 							Note: Severe drug-induced skin rashes and pruritus may necessitate discontinuation of drug use. Symptoms usually subside rapidly
            when drug is withdrawn. 						
         </li>
<li>Check urine for sugar and ketone bodies at least 3 times daily during insulin withdrawal and transfer to glipizide. Contact
            physician if tests are abnormal.
         </li>
<li> 							Note: Patients transferred from a sulfonylurea with a long half-life (e.g., chlorpropamide, half-life: 3040 h) must be observed
            for hypoglycemic responses (see Appendix F) for 12 wk because of potential overlapping of drug effect. 						
         </li>
<li> 							Note: The first signs of hypoglycemia may be hard to detect in patients receiving concurrent beta blockers or older adults. 						</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Overdose treatment: Treat mild hypoglycemia (reaction without loss of consciousness or neurologic symptoms) with PO glucose
            and adjustment of dosage and meal pattern; monitor closely for at least 57 d to assure reestablishment of safe control.
            Severe hypoglycemia requires emergency hospitalization to permit treatment to maintain a blood glucose level above 100 mg/dL.
         </li>
<li> 							Note: Glipizide therapy accompanies (does <small>NOT</small> substitute for) continued control of diet and (if patient is obese) a weight-loss program. 						
         </li>
<li>Test fasting and postprandial blood glucose frequently.</li>
<li>Exercise is an important part of the total control program.</li>
<li>When a drug that affects the hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas (see <small>DRUG INTERACTIONS</small>) is withdrawn or added to the glipizide regimen, be alert to the added danger of loss of control. Urine and blood glucose
            tests and test for ketone bodies should be carefully monitored.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
