<p>2.5 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Potent, long-acting secondary amine nondepolarizing ganglionic blocking agent. Blocks neurotransmission at both sympathetic
         and parasympathetic ganglia by competing with acetylcholine (Ach) for cholinergic receptor sites on postsynaptic membranes.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Reduces BP in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals, generally with greater decrease in standing or sitting BP than
         in supine BPs.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Moderately severe to severe hypertension and uncomplicated malignant hypertension.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Coronary insufficiency, pyloric stenosis; glaucoma; uremia, chronic pyelonephritis; recent MI; mild labile hypertension; unreliable
         uncooperative patients; pregnancy (category C), lactation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Rising or elevated BUN; renal, cerebral, or coronary vascular pathology; recent CVA; prostatic hypertrophy, bladder neck obstruction,
         urethral stricture.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give after meals for more gradual absorption and smoother control of BP. Schedule consistently relative to meals.</li>
<li> 					Note: Because of diurnal variations in BP, physician may prescribe a relatively small dose in the morning or omission of morning
            dose (morning BP usually lower) and larger doses for afternoon or evening. 				
         </li>
<li>Do not suddenly discontinue drug; may result in severe hypertensive rebound with CVA and acute CHF. Usually, other antihypertensive
            therapy must be substituted gradually, and patient must be supervised daily during period of dosage adjustment.
         </li>
<li>Store at 15°30° C (59°86° F) unless otherwise directed.</li>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor therapeutic effectiveness by taking BP readings in standing position at time of maximal drug effect. Assess for symptoms
            of orthostatic hypotension (faintness, dizziness, light-headedness). Also note any changes in pulse rate.
         </li>
<li>Monitor BP closely. Partial tolerance may develop in some patients, necessitating dosage adjustment.</li>
<li>Report promptly constipation, frequent loose stools with abdominal distension, or decreased bowel sounds; may be the first
            signs of paralytic ileus (relatively frequent). Paralytic ileus is sometimes preceded by small, frequent stools.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Make position changes slowly and in stages, particularly from recumbent to upright posture; sit on edge of bed and move ankles
            and feet before walking.
         </li>
<li>Lie down immediately if feeling light-headed or dizzy. Report adverse reactions immediately because drug effects may last
            hours to days after drug is discontinued.
         </li>
<li>Seasonal variations may alter the hypotensive effect (e.g., usually smaller doses are required in summer than in winter).</li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in potentially hazardous activities until response to drug is known.</li>
<li>Learn measures to relieve dry mouth; rinse mouth frequently with water, suck hard candy.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while using this drug.</li>
