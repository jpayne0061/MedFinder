<p>1.5 mg vial</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Nesiritide is a human B-type natriuretic peptide (hBNP), produced by recombinant DNA, which mimics the actions of human atrial
         natriuretic hormone (ANH). ANH is secreted by the right atrium when atrial blood pressure increases. Nesiritide, like ANH,
         inhibits antidiuretic hormone (ADH) by increasing urine sodium loss by the kidney and triggering the formation of a large
         volume of dilute urine.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Nesiritide binds to a cyclic nucleic acid, which results in smooth muscle cell relaxation. The drug also causes dilation of
         veins and arteries. It is effective in managing dyspnea at rest in patients with acute congestive heart failure (CHF).
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Acute treatment of decompensated CHF in patients who have dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to nesiritide, patients with a systolic blood pressure 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Lactation, concurrent administration of ACE inhibitors or vasodilators. Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not
         been established.

               Monitor blood pressure closely. If hypotension occurs, the dose should be reduced or discontinued. The infusion can subsequently
               be restarted at a dose that is reduced by 30% (with no bolus administration) after stabilization of hemodynamics.<br/></td>

                  D5/0.45% NaCl, D5/0.2% NaCl). Rock the vial gently so that all surfaces, including the stopper, contact the diluent
                  ensuring complete reconstitution. Do not shake the vial. Add the entire contents of the vial to the 250 mL IV bag to yield
                  approximately 6 mcg/mL. Invert the bag several times to mix completely. Use within 24 h. Prime the IV tubing with 25 mL prior

<ul>
<li>Monitor hemodynamic parameters (e.g., BP, PCWP, HR, ECG) throughout therapy. Notify physician immediately if systolic BP 
         </li><li>Establish hypotension parameters prior to initiating therapy.</li>
<li>Reduce the dose or withhold the drug if hypotension occurs during administration. Reinitiate therapy infusion only after hypotension
            is corrected. Subsequent doses following a hypotensive episode are usually reduced by 30% and given without a prior bolus
            dose.
