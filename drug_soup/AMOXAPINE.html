<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and secondary amine with mixed antidepressant and neuroleptic tranquilizing properties. Unlike
         some TCAs, not associated with severe cardiotoxicity, has mild sedative action, and causes slight orthostatic hypotension.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Antidepressant activity is thought to be due to reduced reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Also blocks response to
         dopamine by dopaminergic receptors.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Neurotic and endogenous depression accompanied by anxiety or agitation.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to other tricyclic compounds; acute recovery period after MI. Safety during pregnancy (category C), lactation,
         or children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>History of convulsive disorders, schizophrenia, manic depression, electroshock therapy; alcohol abuse; history of urinary
         retention, benign prostatic hypertrophy; angle-closure glaucoma or increased intraocular pressure; cardiovascular disorders;
         impaired renal or hepatic function; elective surgery.

<ul>
<li>Monitor therapeutic effectiveness. Initial antidepressant effect (mild euphoria, increased energy) may occur within 47
            d; however, in most patients clinical response does not occur until after 23 wk of drug therapy.
         </li>
<li>Supervise patient closely during therapy for suicidal ideation and potential serious adverse effects.</li>
<li>Report immediately signs of neuroleptic malignant syndrome: fever, sweating, rigidity (catatonia), unstable BP, rapid, irregular
            pulse; changes in level of consciousness, coma. Although rare, it can be life-threatening if drug is not stopped immediately.
            Death can result from acute respiratory, renal, or cardiovascular failure.
         </li>
<li>Report immediately the onset of signs of tardive dyskinesia (see Appendix F); careful observation/reporting may prevent irreversibility.</li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O ratio and bowel elimination pattern. Report continuing constipation.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Follow directions for taking this drug (see <small>ADMINISTRATION</small>).
         </li>
<li>Do not abruptly discontinue drug. Dosage should be tapered over 2 wk. Maintain established dosage regimen. Do not skip, reduce,
            or double doses or change dose intervals.
         </li>
<li>Minimize alcohol intake as it may potentiate drug effects, thus increasing the dangers of overdosage or suicidal ideation.</li>
<li>Drink at least 2000 mL (approximately 2 qts) fluid daily and eat foods with high fiber content (if allowed) to provide needed
            roughage.
         </li>
<li>Monitor weight at least weekly and report significant weight gain.</li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in potentially hazardous tasks until response to drug is known.</li>
<li>Rinse mouth frequently with clear water, especially after eating, to relieve mouth dryness.</li>
<li>Do not take any prescription or OTC drugs without consulting physician.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
