<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Reduces plasma cholesterol levels by interfering with body's ability to produce its own cholesterol. This cholesterol-lowering
         effect triggers induction of LDL receptors, which promote removal of LDL and VLDL remnants (precursors of LDL) from plasma.
         Also results in an increase in plasma HDL concentrations (HDL collects excess cholesterol from body cells and transports it
         to liver for excretion).
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Reduces plasma cholesterol levels by interfering with body's ability to produce its own cholesterol, and it also lowers LDL
         and VLDL cholesterol.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjunct to diet for treatment of primary moderate hypercholesterolemia (types IIa and IIb) when diet and other nonpharmacologic
         measures have failed to reduce elevated total LDL cholesterol levels. Lovastatin is less effective in treatment of homozygous
         familial hypercholesterolemia than primary hypercholesterolemia, possibly because in these persons LDL receptors are not functional.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Active liver disease, unexplained elevations of serum transaminases; cholestasis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic disease,
         hepatitis, jaundice; rhabdomyolysis; surgery, trauma; hypotension, renal failure; pregnancy (category X), lactation, children
         
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Patient who consumes substantial quantities of alcohol; history of liver disease; electrolyte imbalance, endocrine disease,
         females of childbearing age, infection, myopathy, renal disease, renal impairment, seizure disorder. Patient with risk factor
         predisposing to development of kidney failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis.

<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Perform liver function tests q46wk during first 15 mo of therapy. Monitor blood cholesterol levels and lipid
            profile periodically.
         </li>
<li>Drug-induced increases in serum transaminases, usually not associated with jaundice or other clinical S&amp;S, return to normal
            when drug is discontinued. If these values rise and remain at 3 times upper level of normal, drug will be discontinued and
            liver biopsy considered.
