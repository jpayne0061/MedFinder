<p>100 units/mL</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Long-acting, cloudy suspension of insulin modified by addition of zinc chloride and protamine sulfate, which has poor solubility
         and thus delays absorption. It is derived from pork pancreas.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Iletin II lowers blood glucose levels by increasing peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat tissue,
         and by inhibiting the liver from changing glycogen to glucose. May be used in combination with a shorter acting form.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Diabetes mellitus in patients who are not adequately controlled by unmodified insulin.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>During episodes of hypoglycemia or in patients sensitive to any ingredient in the formulation.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>In insulin resistant patients, hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism; lactation, older adults, pregnancy (category B), renal or
         hepatic impairment. Safety and efficacy in children

<li>Give PZI 30 min before breakfast.</li>
<li>Ensure complete dispersion by mixing thoroughly, then gently rotating vial between palms and inverting it end to end several
            times. Do not shake.
         </li>
<li> 				Note: PZI is compatible with regular insulin. Do <small>NOT</small> mix insulins unless prescribed by physician. 			
         </li>
<li>Prepare solution immediately before administration when mixing regular insulin with PZI. Withdraw insulin injection into syringe
            before PZI.
         </li>
<li>Store unopened vial at 2°8° C (36°46° F); store vial in use at 15°30° C (59°86°
            F). Avoid freezing and exposure to extremes in temperature or to direct sunlight.
         </li>

<ul>
<li>Monitor therapeutic effectiveness: May be delayed several days following institution of treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Distribute carbohydrates carefully in a balanced diet to prolong insulin effect.</li>
<li> 							Note: Between-meal snacks may be necessary; bedtime snacks are essential. 						</li>
<li> 							Note: If injection is given in the morning, hypoglycemia is most likely to occur during the night or early morning. 						</li>
<li>Learn to be alert to the significance of sweating or fatigue unwarranted by activity, as well as other vague symptoms such
            as lassitude, drowsiness, tremulousness. Blood glucose levels fall slowly after injection of PZI; marked hypoglycemia may
            develop without an apparent cluster of symptoms.
         </li>
<li>Learn to treat PZI-induced hypoglycemia, first with fast acting and complex carbohydrate (e.g., corn syrup or honey with bread),
            followed in 12 h by additional "slow" carbohydrates, such as milk and crackers.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
