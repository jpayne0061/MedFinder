<p>1 g tablets; 1 g/10 mL suspension</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>A complex of aluminum hydroxide and sulfated sucrose structurally related to heparin that lacks its anticoagulant activity.
         Action is chemically unlike any other drug used for antiulcer therapy. Following oral administration, sucralfate and gastric
         acid react to form a viscous, adhesive, paste-like substance that resists further reaction with acid. This "paste"
         adheres to the GI mucosa with a major portion binding electrostatically to the positively charged protein molecules in the
         damaged mucosa of an ulcer crater or an acute gastric erosion caused by alcohol or other drugs.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Absorbs bile, inhibits the enzyme pepsin, and blocks back diffusion of H<sup>+</sup> ions. These actions plus adherence of the paste-like complex protect damaged mucosa against further destruction from ulcerogenic
         secretions and drugs.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Short-term (up to 8 wk) treatment of duodenal ulcer.</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Short-term treatment of gastric ulcer, aspirin-induced erosions, suspension for chemotherapy-induced mucositis.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Pregnancy (category B). Safety and efficacy in children are not established.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Chronic kidney failure or dialysis due to aluminum accumulation; lactation.</p>

<li>Use drug solubilized in an appropriate diluent by a pharmacist when given through nasogastric tube.</li>
<li>Administer antacids prescribed for pain relief 30 min before or after sucralfate.</li>
<li>Separate administration of <small>QUINOLONES</small>, digoxin, phenytoin, tetracycline from that of sucralfate by 2 h to prevent sucralfate from binding to these compounds in
            the intestinal tract and reducing their bioavailability.
         </li>
<li>Store in tight container at room temperature, 15°30° C (59°86° F). Stable for 2 y after manufacture.</li>

<ul>
<li>Although healing has occurred within the first 2 wk of therapy, treatment is usually continued 48 wk.</li>
<li>Be aware that constipation is a drug-related problem. Follow these measures unless contraindicated: Increase water intake
            to 810 glasses per day; increase physical exercise, increase dietary bulk. Consult physician: a suppository or bulk
            laxative (e.g., Metamucil) may be prescribed.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
