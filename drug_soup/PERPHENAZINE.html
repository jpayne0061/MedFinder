<p>2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg, tablets; 16 mg/5 mL liquid; 5 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Affects all parts of CNS similar to chlorpromazine, particularly the hypothalamus. Antipsychotic effect: Antagonizes the neurotransmitter
         dopamine by action on dopamine receptors in the brain. Antiemetic action results from direct blockade of dopamine in the chemoreceptor
         trigger zone (CTZ) in the medulla.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Has antipychotic and antiemetic properties. Produces less sedation and hypotension, greater antiemetic effects, higher incidence
         of extrapyramidal effects, and lower levels of anticholinergic adverse effects than chlorpromazine.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Psychotic disorders, symptomatic control of severe nausea and vomiting, acute conditions such as violent retching during surgery,
         and intractable hiccups.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to perphenazine and other phenothiazines; preexisting liver damage; suspected or established subcortical
         brain damage, comatose states; bone marrow depression. Safety during pregnancy (category C), lactation, or in children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Previously diagnosed breast cancer; liver or kidney dysfunction; cardiovascular disorders; alcohol withdrawal, epilepsy, psychic
         depression, patients with suicidal tendency; glaucoma; history of intestinal or GU obstruction; geriatric or debilitated patients;
         patients who will be exposed to extremes of heat or cold, or to phosphorous insecticides.

<ul>
<li>Establish baseline BP before initiation of drug therapy and check it at regular intervals, especially during early therapy.</li>
<li>Monitor BP and pulse continuously during IV administration. Keep patient supine until assured that vital signs are stable.
            Observe older adult patients carefully for hypotension and extrapyramidal reactions.
         </li>
<li>Report restlessness, weakness of extremities, dystonic reactions (spasms of neck and shoulder muscles, rigidity of back, difficulty
            swallowing or talking); motor restlessness (akathisia: inability to be still); and parkinsonian syndrome (tremors, shuffling
            gait, drooling, slow speech). A high incidence of extrapyramidal effects accompanies use of perphenazine, particularly with
            high doses and parenteral administration.
         </li>
<li>Withhold medication and report <small>IMMEDIATELY</small> to physician S&amp;S of irreversible tardive dyskinesia (i.e., fine, wormlike movements or rapid protrusions of the tongue, chewing
            motions, lip smacking). Patients on long-term therapy are high risk. Teach patients and responsible family members about symptoms
            because early reporting is essential.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Obtain differential blood cell counts and liver; and kidney function studies.</li>
<li>ECG and ophthalmologic examination are recommended prior to initiation and periodically during therapy.</li>
<li>Suspect hypersensitivity, withhold drug, and report to physician if jaundice appears between weeks 2 and 4.</li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O ratio and bowel elimination pattern.</li>
<li>Be alert to potential for altered tolerance to environmental temperature changes. Be cautious with external heat devices.
            Conditioned avoidance behavior may be depressed, and a severe burn could result.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Make all position changes slowly and in stages, particularly from recumbent to upright posture, and to lie down or sit down
            if light-headedness or dizziness occurs.
         </li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in potentially hazardous activities until response to drug is known. Drug may produce hypotension (dizziness,
            light-headedness), and sedation especially during early therapy.
         </li>
<li>Discontinue drug and report to physician immediately if jaundice appears between weeks 2 and 4.</li>
<li>Avoid long exposure to sunlight and to sunlamps. Photosensitivity results in skin color changes from brown to blue-gray.</li>
<li>Adhere to dosage regimen strictly. Contact physician before changing it for any reason.</li>
<li>Discontinue gradually over a period of several weeks following prolonged therapy.</li>
<li>Avoid OTC drugs unless physician prescribes them.</li>
<li>Be aware that perphenazine may discolor urine reddish brown.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
