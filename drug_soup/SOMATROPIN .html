<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>New recombinant growth hormone with the natural sequence of 191 amino acids characteristic of endogenous growth hormone (GH).
         Differs from somatrem by absence of an extra methionyl group in its structure. Somatropin appears to be less likely to produce
         serum antibodies to endogenous GH than somatrem.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Induces growth responses similar to those produced in children treated with somatrem or with GH obtained from human pituitary
         glands.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Growth failure due to GH deficiency; replacement therapy prior to epiphyseal closure in patients with idiopathic GH deficiency;
         GH deficiency secondary to intracranial tumors or panhypopituitarism; inadequate GH secretion; short stature in girls with
         Turner's syndrome; AIDS wasting syndrome; short bowel syndrome.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>

         diabetic retinopathy; during chemotherapy, radiation therapy, active neoplastic disease; Prader-Willi syndrome; untreated
         hypothyroidism, obesity; pregnancy (category B or category C depending on the brand).
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>

         lactation; concomitant or prior use of thyroid or androgens in prepubertal male; hypothyroidism; surgery, trauma; neonates
         with benzyl alcohol hypersensitivity; neonates.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Subcutaneous</span><br/><ul>
<li>Reconstitute each brand following it's manufacturer's instructions (vary from brand to brand).</li>
<li>Read and carefully follow directions for use supplied with the Nutropin AQ Pen<sup><small>TM</small></sup> Cartridge if this
            is the product being used.
         </li>
<li>Rotate injection sites; abdomen and thighs are preferred sites. Do not use buttocks until the child has been walking for a
            year or more and the muscle is adequately developed.
         </li>
<li>Store lyophilized powder at 2°8° C (36°46° F). After reconstitution, most preparations are
            stable for at least 14 d under refrigeration. DO NOT FREEZE.
         </li>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Assess bone age annually in all patients and especially those also receiving concurrent thyroid or androgen treatment, since
            these drugs may precipitate early epiphyseal closure. Urge parent to take child for bone age assessment on appointed annual
            dates.
         </li>
<li>Lab test: Periodic serum and urine calcium and plasma glucose.</li>
<li>Hypercalciuria, a frequent adverse effect in the first 23 mo of therapy, may be symptomless; however, it may be accompanied
            by renal calculi, with these reportable symptoms: flank pain and colic, GI symptoms, urinary frequency, chills, fever, hematuria.
         </li>
<li>Test for circulating GH antibodies (antisomatropin antibodies) in patients who respond initially but later fail to respond
            to therapy.
         </li>
<li>Observe diabetics or those with family history of diabetes closely. Obtain regular urine for glycosuria or fasting blood glucose
            and HbA<sub>1C</sub>.
         </li>
<li>Examine patients with GH deficiency secondary to intracranial lesion frequently for progression or recurrence of underlying
            disease.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Be aware that during first 6 mo of successful treatment, linear growth rates may be increased 816 cm or more per year
            (average about 7 cm/y or approximately 3 in.). Additionally, SC fat diminishes but returns to pretreatment value later.
         </li>
<li>Record accurate height measurements at regular intervals and report to physician if rate is less than expected.</li>
<li>In general, growth response to somatropin is inversely proportional to duration of treatment.</li>
<li>Discontinue treatment when patient has reached satisfactory adult height, when epiphyses have fused, or when patient fails
            to exhibit growth response.
         </li>
