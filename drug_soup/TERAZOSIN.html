<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Quinazoline antihypertensive and vasodilator chemically similar to prazosin. Selectively blocks alpha<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors in vascular smooth muscle producing relaxation that leads to reduction of peripheral vascular resistance
         and lowered BP. Vasodilation is accompanied by minimal reflex increase in heart rate.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Antihypertensive drug therapy reserved for patient who has failed to respond to diet, exercise, weight reduction, and other
         drug therapy. Effective when used with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent and a thiazide diuretic.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>To treat hypertension alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents (beta-adrenergic blocking agents, diuretics).
         To treat benign prostatic hypertrophy.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Urinary outflow obstruction.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity. Safety during pregnancy (category C) or in children is not established.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Patients with BPH; prostate cancer; history of hypotensive episodes; lactation.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give initial dose at bedtime to reduce the potential for severe hypotensive effect, which may occur with first few doses.
            After the initial dose, give any time of day.
         </li>
<li>Store at 15°30° C (59°86° F) in tightly closed container away from heat and strong light.
            Do not freeze.

<ul>
<li>Be alert for possible first-dose phenomenon (precipitous decline in BP with consciousness disturbance). This is rare; occurs
            within 90120 min of initial dose.
         </li>
<li>Monitor BP at end of dosing interval (just before next dose) to determine level of antihypertensive control. Check BP also
            23 h after the dose to determine if maximum and minimal responses are similar.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that drug-induced decrease in BP appears to be more position dependent (i.e., greater in the erect position) during
            the first few hours after dosing than at end of 24 h.
         </li>
<li>A greatly diminished hypotensive response at end of 24 h indicates need for change in dosage (increased dose or twice daily
            regimen). Report to physician.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid situations that would result in injury should syncope (loss of consciousness) occur after first dose. If faintness develops,
            lie down promptly.
         </li>
<li>Make position changes slowly (i.e., change in direction or from recumbent to upright posture). Dangle legs and move ankles
            a minute or so before standing when arising. Orthostatic hypotension (greatest shortly after dosing) can pose a problem with
            ambulation.
         </li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in potentially hazardous activities for at least 12 h after first dose, after dosage increase, or when
            treatment is resumed after interruption of therapy. Twelve hours should be sufficient time for serious adverse effects (syncope,
            orthostatic hypotension, light-headedness, dizziness) to appear if they are going to do so.
         </li>
<li>Monitor weight: Report sudden gain of more than 0.51 kg (12 lb) accompanied by edema in extremities to physician.
            Dose adjustment may be indicated.
         </li>
<li>Do not alter established drug regimen. Consult physician if drug is omitted for several days. Drug will be started with the
            initial dosing regimen.
         </li>
<li>Keep scheduled appointments for assessment of BP control and other clinically significant tests.</li>
<li>Keep a daily record noting BP and time taken, which arm was used, position (i.e., standing, sitting), and time when medication
            was taken. Take this record to physician for reference at checkup appointment.
         </li>
<li>Do not take OTC medications, particularly those that may contain an adrenergic agent (e.g., remedies for coughs, colds, allergy)
            without first consulting physician.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
