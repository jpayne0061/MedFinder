<p>1 g, 2 g injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Semisynthetic, second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic similar to other drugs of this class. Preferentially binds to one
         or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) located on cell walls of susceptible organisms. This inhibits third and final
         stage of bacterial wall synthesis, thus killing the bacterium.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Usually active against organisms susceptible to first generation cephalosporins. In addition, it is active against the anaerobes
         <i>Clostridium</i> sp, <i>Peptococcus</i> sp, <i>Fusobacterium</i> sp; and against some strains of <i>Providencia</i> sp, <i>Enterobacter, Serratia, Proteus, Escherichia coli,</i> and <i>Klebsiella</i> resistant to first generation cephalosporins. Inactive against <i>Enterococci,</i> methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococci</i> (MRSA), <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i>. Partial cross-allergenicity between penicillins and cephalosporins has been reported. Effective treatment for bone and joint
         infections, lower respiratory tract infections, peritonitis, urinary tract infections and surgical prophylaxis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Serious infections of respiratory, genitourinary, and biliary tracts, skin and soft tissue, bones and joints, and in septicemia
         and peritonitis (caused by <i>E. coli</i> and other coliform microbes); also perioperative prophylaxis to reduce infections in patient undergoing potentially contaminated
         procedure.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins and related antibiotics; pregnancy (category B), lactation. Safe use in children between
         1 and 6 mo not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>History of sensitivity to penicillins or other drug allergies; renal function impairment; history of GI disease, particularly
         colitis.

<li>Prolonged exposure to light causes cefamandole powder to discolor. Once reconstituted, cefamandole is no longer light sensitive.
                     Solutions appear light yellow to amber. Do not use if otherwise colored or if a precipitate is present.

<li>After reconstitution, cefamandole may liberate CO<sub>2</sub>. Do not store medication in syringes, as pressure build-up from CO<sub>2</sub> may force plunger out of barrel.

<ul>
<li>Determine previous hypersensitivity to cephalosporins, penicillins, and other drugs prior to initiating therapy.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Perform culture and sensitivity testing prior to and periodically during therapy. Cefamandole therapy may be instituted
            pending test results. Baseline and periodic studies of renal function and PT determinations should be performed.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O rates and pattern: Particularly important in patients with impaired renal function, patients &gt;50 y, or patients
            who are receiving high doses.
         </li>
<li>Antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous enterocolitis (life-threatening) is a superinfection caused by <i>Clostridia difficile</i> and may occur in 49 d or as long as 6 wk after cefamandole is discontinued (see Signs &amp; Symptoms, Appendix F). Most
            likely to occur in the chronically ill or debilitated older adult patient, especially if undergoing abdominal surgery or if
            in an ICU.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Check for fever if you have diarrhea and report fever and diarrhea to your physician.</li>
<li>If you experience any signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (see Appendix F), discontinue your drug and consult with your
            physician.
         </li>
<li>Avoid use of alcohol during and for 4872 h after taking cefamandole. A drug-induced disulfiram-like reaction (see Appendix
            F) may follow alcohol intake.
         </li>
<li>Report promptly any signs or symptoms of superinfection (see Appendix F). Superinfections may occur, particularly during prolonged
            use of cephalosporins.
         </li>
<li>Yogurt or buttermilk, 120 mL (4 oz) of either (if allowed), may serve as a prophylactic against intestinal superinfection
            by helping to maintain normal intestinal flora.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
