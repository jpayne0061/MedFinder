<p>50 mg capsules; 20 mg/mL injection; 100 mg lyophilized powder for injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Semisynthetic derivative of May apple plant. Produces cytotoxic action by unclear mechanism. Primary action is by arresting
         G<sub>2</sub> (resting or premitotic) phase of cell cycle; also acts on S phase of DNA synthesis. High doses cause lysis of cells entering
         mitotic phase, and lower doses inhibit cells from entering prophase.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Antineoplastic effect is due to its ability to arrest mitosis (cell division).</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Treatment of refractory testicular neoplasms, in patients who have already received appropriate surgical, chemotherapeutic,
         and radiation therapy; for treatment of choriocarcinoma in women and small cell carcinoma of the lung.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, acute myelogenous (nonlymphocytic) leukemia.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Severe bone marrow depression; severe hepatic or renal impairment; existing or recent viral infection, bacterial infection;
         intraperitoneal, intrapleural, or intrathecal administration. Safety during pregnancy (category D), lactation, or in children
         is not established.

<ul>
<li>Check IV site during and after infusion. Extravasation can cause thrombophlebitis and necrosis.</li>
<li>Be prepared to treat an anaphylactoid reaction (see Appendix F). Stop infusion immediately if the reaction occurs.</li>
<li>Monitor vital signs during and after infusion. Stop infusion immediately if hypotension occurs.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Perform baseline all prior to and at regular intervals during therapy, and before each subsequent treatment course.
            Tests include: CBC with differential; liver and kidney function tests (AST, ALT, serum bilirubin, LDH, BUN, serum creatinine).
         </li>
<li>Withhold therapy when an absolute neutrophil count is below 500/mm<sup>3</sup> or a platelet count below 50,000/mm<sup>3</sup>.
         </li>
<li>Be alert to evidence of patient complaints that might suggest development of leukopenia (see Appendix F), infection (immunosuppression),
            and bleeding.
         </li>
<li>Protect patient from any trauma that might precipitate bleeding during period of platelet nadir particularly. Withhold invasive
            procedures if possible.

<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn possible adverse effects of etoposide, such as blood dyscrasias, alopecia, carcinogenesis, before treatment begins.</li>
<li>Make position changes slowly, particularly from lying to upright position because transient hypotension after therapy is possible.</li>
<li>Inspect mouth daily for ulcerations and bleeding. Avoid obvious irritants such as hot or spicy foods, smoking, alcohol.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
