<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Major actions appear to be associated primarily with inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins involved in the production
         of inflammation, pain, and fever. <b>Antiinflammatory action:</b> Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis. As an antiinflammatory agent, aspirin appears to be involved in enhancing antigen removal
         and in reducing the spread of inflammation in ground substances. These antiinflammatory actions also contribute to analgesic
         effects. <b>Analgesic action:</b> Principally peripheral with limited action in the CNS, possibly on the hypothalamus; results in relief of mild to moderate
         pain. <b>Antipyretic action:</b> In addition to inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, aspirin lowers body temperature in fever by indirectly causing centrally
         mediated peripheral vasodilation and sweating. <b>Antiplatelet action:</b> Aspirin (but not other salicylates) powerfully inhibits platelet aggregation. High serum salicylate concentrations can impair
         hepatic synthesis of blood coagulation factors VII, IX, and X, possibly by inhibiting action of vitamin K.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Reduces inflammation, pain, and fever. Also inhibits platelet aggregation, reducing ability of blood to clot.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>To relieve pain of low to moderate intensity. Also for various inflammatory conditions, such as acute rheumatic fever, Systemic
         Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, bursitis, and calcific tendonitis, and to reduce fever in selected febrile conditions.
         Used to reduce recurrence of TIA due to fibrin platelet emboli and risk of stroke in men; to prevent recurrence of MI; as
         prophylaxis against MI in men with unstable angina.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>As prophylactic against thromboembolism; to prevent cataract and progression of diabetic retinopathy; and to control symptoms
         related to gluten sensitivity.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor for loss of tolerance to aspirin. The reaction is nonimmunologic; symptoms usually occur 15 min to 3 h after ingestion:
            profuse rhinorrhea, erythema, nausea, vomiting, intestinal cramps, diarrhea.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: frequent PT and IRN with concurrent anticoagulant therapy; more frequent fasting blood glucose levels with diabetes.</li>
<li>Monitor the diabetic child carefully for need to adjust insulin dose. Children on high doses of aspirin are particularly prone
            to hypoglycemia (see Appendix F).
         </li>
<li>Monitor for salicylate toxicity. In adults, a sensation of fullness in the ears, tinnitus, and decreased or muffled hearing
            are the most frequent symptoms associated with chronic salicylate overdosage.
         </li>
<li>Monitor children closely because salicylate toxicity is enhanced by the dehydration that frequently accompanies fever or illness.
            Children tend to manifest salicylate toxicity by hyperventilation, agitation, mental confusion, or other behavioral changes,
            drowsiness, lethargy, sweating, and constipation.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Potential for toxicity is high in older adults and patients with asthma, nasal polyps, perennial vasomotor rhinitis, hay fever,
            or chronic urticaria.
            						
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not give aspirin to children or teenagers with symptoms of varicella (chickenpox) or influenza-like illnesses because of
            association of aspirin usage with Reye's syndrome.
         </li>
<li>Use enteric-coated tablets, extended release tablets, buffered aspirin, or aspirin administered with an antacid to reduce
            GI disturbances.
         </li>
<li>Take aspirin 12 d before menses when prescribed for dysmenorrhea. When experiencing heavy menstrual blood loss, take
            another analgesic, such as acetaminophen, instead of aspirin.
         </li>
<li>Discontinue aspirin therapy about 1 wk before surgery to reduce risk of bleeding. Do not use aspirin-containing gum or gargles
            or chew aspirin products for at least 1 wk following oral surgery.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Chronic use of high-dose aspirin during the last 3 mo of pregnancy can prolong pregnancy and labor, increase maternal bleeding
            before and after-delivery, and cause weight increase and hemorrhage in the neonate.
            						
         </li>
<li>Discontinue aspirin use with onset of ringing or buzzing in the ears, impaired hearing, dizziness, GI discomfort or bleeding,
            and report to physician.
         </li>
<li>Do not use aspirin for self-medication of pain (adults) beyond 5 d without consulting a physician. Do not use aspirin longer
            than 3 d for fever (adults and children), never for fever over 38.9° C (102° F) in older adults or 39.5° C
            (103° F) in children and adults under 60 yrs or for recurrent fever without medical direction.
         </li>
<li>Consult physician before using aspirin for any fever accompanied by rash, severe headache, stiff neck, marked irritability,
            or confusion (all possible symptoms of meningitis).
         </li>
<li>Avoid alcohol when taking large doses of aspirin.</li>
<li>Observe and report signs of bleeding (e.g., petechiae, ecchymoses, bleeding gums, bloody or black stools, cloudy or bloody
            urine).
         </li>
<li>Maintain adequate fluid intake when taking repeated doses of aspirin.</li>
<li>Avoid other medications containing aspirin unless directed by physician, because of danger of overdosing (there are more than
            500 OTC aspirin-containing compounds).
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
