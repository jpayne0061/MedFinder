<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Semisynthetic, second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic with drug structure characterized by a beta-lactam ring (like the
         penicillin structure); generally resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases. Preferentially binds to one or more of the penicillin-binding
         proteins (PBP) located on cell walls of susceptible organisms. This inhibits third and final stage of bacterial wall synthesis,
         thus killing the bacterium. Second generation cephalosporins are usually active against the organisms susceptible to first
         generation cephalosporins.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Active against <i>Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia</i> sp, <i>Clostridium</i> sp, <i>Peptococcus</i> sp, and against some strains of <i>Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Serratia, Neisseria, Proteus, Escherichia coli,</i> and <i>Klebsiella</i> that are resistant to first generation cephalosporins. Second generation agents are generally inactive against <i>Enterococci,</i> methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococci</i> (MRSA), <i>Acinetobacter, Listeria monocytogenes,</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i>. Active against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Effectively treats bone and
         joint infections, gonorrhea, lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, septicemia, skin and soft tissue
         infections and used for surgical prophylaxis, reducing or eliminating signs and symptoms of infection.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Moderate to severe infections such as septicemia, infections of lower respiratory tract, bones and joints, skin and skin structures,
         and urinary tract (UTI). Also used for perioperative prophylaxis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Uncomplicated gonorrhea.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins and related antibiotics; severely impaired renal or hepatic function; pregnancy (category
         B). Safe use in children not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Lactation; patient with history of delayed-type reaction to penicillins or other drugs; GI disease, especially colitis.</p>

<ul>
<li>
            				Note: When cefonicid is given for prophylaxis during cesarean section, it is administered only after umbilical cord has been clamped.
            			
         </li>
</ul><span class="adminroutetype">Intramuscular</span><br/><ul>
<li>Reconstitute with sterile water for injection. Add 2 mL of diluent to 500 mg of drug to yield 220 mg/mL; add 2.5 mL diluent
            to 1 g of drug to yield 325 mg 1 mL. Shake well to assure complete dissolution of drug. After reconstitution, inspect for
            particulate matter; if present, discard solution.
         </li>
<li>IM injections should be made deeply into large muscle mass. Pain and discomfort at IM site occurs commonly. If dose is 2 g,
            give ½ dose in a different large muscle mass. Rotate injection sites.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Determine history of hypersensitivity to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs before therapy begins.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Perform culture and sensitivity tests before and periodically during therapy, if indicated. Therapy may be initiated
            before test results are available. Perform periodic hematologic studies including PT/INR and PTT and evaluations of renal
            and hepatic functions in patients receiving high doses and during prolonged therapy.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O rates and pattern: Particularly important in patients with impaired renal function, patients &gt;50 y, or who are
            receiving high doses.
         </li>
<li>Monitor temperature. Report temperature alterations and the onset of flu-like symptoms (chills, malaise).</li>
<li>Monitor for superinfections caused by overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, particularly during prolonged use of cephalosporins.</li>
<li>Antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous enterocolitis is a life-threatening superinfection caused by <i>Clostridium difficile;</i> may occur in 49 d or as long as 6 wk after cefonicid is discontinued. Most apt to occur in the chronically ill or debilitated
            older adult patient, especially if undergoing abdominal surgery or if in an intensive care unit.
         </li>
<li>Check for fever if diarrhea occurs. Report diarrhea and fever promptly.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Superinfections caused by overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms may occur, particularly during prolonged use of cephalosporins.
            Report early S&amp;S (see Appendix F) promptly.
         </li>
<li>Report loose stools or diarrhea.</li>
<li>Yogurt or buttermilk, 120 mL (4 oz) of either (if allowed), may serve as a prophylactic against intestinal superinfection
            by helping to maintain normal intestinal flora.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
