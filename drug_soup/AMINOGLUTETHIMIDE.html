<p>250 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Blocks adrenal corticosteroid biosynthesis by inhibiting enzymatic conversion of cholesterol to precursors of cortisol and
         aldosterone. Also blocks aromatase, thereby preventing conversion of androgens to estrogens in peripheral tissues.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Because estrogens are supplied principally by the adrenals in postmenopausal and oophorectomized women, aminoglutethimide-induced
         lowering of plasma estrogen levels (by adrenal suppression) is reportedly as effective as that produced by surgical adrenalectomy.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Temporary treatment of selected patients with Cushing's syndrome associated with adrenal carcinoma, ectopic ACTH-producing
         tumors, or adrenal hyperplasia.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>To produce medical adrenalectomy in postmenopausal women with positive estrogen receptor test, metastatic breast cancer, or
         who fail or relapse with tamoxifen (Nolvadex), and for patients with prostatic carcinoma.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypothyroidism; infection. Safety during pregnancy (category D), lactation, and in children is not established.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Older adults.</p>

<ul>
<li>Monitor &amp; report S&amp;S of: Adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism (see Appendix F); in older adults, CNS effects (e.g., lethargy,
            ataxia, orthostatic dizziness, lightheadedness).
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Baseline &amp; periodic fasting plasma cortisol levels, periodic CBC with differential, serum electrolytes, serum alkaline
            phosphate, liver functions, and thyroid function.
         </li>
<li>Monitor BP in the recumbent and upright positions to evaluate fluid volume status and presence of orthostatic hypotension.</li>
<li>
            							Note: Dose reduction or temporary discontinuation may be indicated by: extreme drowsiness, severe skin rash, extremely low cortisol
            levels.
            						
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Patients with Cushing's syndrome may show reduced effect with continuing therapy and generally are not treated beyond 3 mo
