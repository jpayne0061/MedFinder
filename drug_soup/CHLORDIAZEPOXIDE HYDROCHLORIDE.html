<li>Give with or immediately after meals or with milk to reduce GI distress. If an antacid is prescribed, it should be taken at
            least 1 h before or after chlordiazepoxide to prevent delay in drug absorption.

</ul><span class="adminroutetype">Intramuscular</span><br/><ul>
<li>Prepare parenteral solution immediately before use; discard unused portion. Drug is unstable in light and when in solution.</li>
<li>Use special diluent provided by manufacturer to make the IM solution. Add diluent carefully to avoid bubble formation; gently
            agitate until solution is clear. Resulting solution: 50 mg/mL. Discard diluent if it is not clear.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor for S&amp;S of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia, which occur more frequently with parenteral administration. Patient
            should stay recumbent 23 h after IM or IV injection; observe closely and monitor vital signs.
         </li>
<li>Check BP and pulse before giving benzodiazepine in early part of therapy. If blood pressure falls 20 mm Hg or more or if pulse
            rate is above 120 bpm, delay medication and consult physician.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Periodic blood cell counts and liver function tests are recommended during prolonged therapy.</li>
<li>Monitor for S&amp;S of agranulocytosis: sore throat or mouth, upper respiratory infection, fever, and malaise. Total and differential
            WBC counts should be ordered immediately, and protective isolation instituted.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O until drug dosage is stabilized. Report changes in I&amp;O ratio and dysuria to physician. Cumulative (overdosage)
            effects can result in renal dysfunction. Older adults are especially vulnerable.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for S&amp;S of paradoxic reactionsexcitement, stimulation, disturbed sleep patterns, acute ragewhich may occur
            during first few weeks of therapy in psychiatric patients and in hyperactive and aggressive children receiving chlordiazepoxide.
            Withhold drug and report to physician.
         </li>
<li>Assess patient's sleep pattern. If dreams or nightmares interfere with rest, notify physician. A change in the dosing schedule,
            dose, or an alternate drug may be prescribed.
         </li>
<li>Supervision of ambulation especially with older adults &amp; debilitated patients.</li>
<li>Observe for signs of developing physical or psychologic dependency such as requests for change in drug regimen (dose and dose
            interval), diminishing favorable response (e.g., disturbed sleep pattern, increase in psychomotor activity), withdrawal symptoms.
            Investigate the symptoms of ataxia, vertigo, slurred speech; the patient may be taking more than the prescribed dose.
         </li>
<li>Abrupt discontinuation of drug in patients receiving high doses for long periods (<img src="../images/special/greaterorequal.gif"/>4
            mo) has precipitated withdrawal symptoms, but not for at least 57 d because of slow elimination.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Take drug specifically as prescribed: do not skip, increase, or decrease doses, change intervals, or terminate therapy without
            physician's advice and do not lend or offer any of drug to another person.
         </li>
<li>Do not take OTC drugs unless prescribed.</li>
<li>Long-term use of this drug may cause xerostomia. Good oral hygiene can alleviate the discomfort.</li>
<li>Avoid activities requiring mental alertness until reaction to the drug has been evaluated.</li>
<li>Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages. When combined with chlordiazepoxide, effects of both are potentiated.</li>
<li>If pregnant during therapy or intending to become pregnant, communicate with physician about continuing therapy.</li>
<li>Avoid excessive sunlight. Photosensitivity has been reported. Use sun screen lotion (SPF 12 or above) if allowed.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
