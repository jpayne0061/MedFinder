<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Centrally acting antiadrenergic derivative. Stimulates alpha<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors in CNS to inhibit sympathetic vasomotor centers. Central actions reduce plasma concentrations of norepinephrine.
         It decreases systolic and diastolic BP and heart rate. Orthostatic effects tend to be mild and occur infrequently. Also inhibits
         renin release from kidneys.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Decreases systolic and diastolic BP and heart rate. Orthostatic effects tend to be mild and occur infrequently. Reportedly
         minimizes or eliminates many of the common clinical S&amp;S associated with withdrawal of heroin, methadone, or other opiates.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Step 2 drug in stepped-care approach to treatment of hypertension, either alone or with diuretic or other antihypertensive
         agents. Epidural administration as adjunct therapy for severe pain.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Give last PO dose immediately before patient retires to ensure overnight BP control and to minimize daytime drowsiness. </li>
<li>Oral dosage is increased gradually over a period of weeks so as not to lower BP abruptly (especially important in the older
            adult). Follow-up visits should be scheduled every 24 wk until BP stabilizes, then every 24 mo.
         </li>
<li>Apply transdermal patch to dry skin, free of hair and rash. Avoid irritated, abraded, or scarred skin. Recommended areas for
            applying transdermal patch are upper outer arm and anterior chest. Less drug is absorbed from thighs. Rotate application sites
            and keep a record.
         </li>
<li>During change from PO clonidine to transdermal system, PO clonidine should be maintained for at least 24 h after patch is
            applied. Consult physician.
         </li>
<li>Do not abruptly discontinue drug. It should be withdrawn over a period of 24 d. Abrupt withdrawal resembles sympathetic
            stimulation and may result in restlessness and headache 23 h after a missed dose and a hypertensive crisis within 818
            h. 
         </li>
<li>Store in tightly closed container at 15°30° C (59°86° F) unless otherwise directed.</li>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor BR closely. Determine positional changes (supine, sitting, standing).</li>
<li>With epidural administration, frequently monitor BP and HR. Hypotension is a common side effect that may require intervention.</li>
<li>Monitor BP closely whenever a drug is added to or withdrawn from therapeutic regimen.</li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O during period of dosage adjustment. Report change in I&amp;O ratio or change in voiding pattern.</li>
<li>Determine weight daily. Patients not receiving a concomitant diuretic agent may gain weight, particularly during first 3 or
            4 d of therapy, because of marked sodium and water retention.
         </li>
<li>Supervise closely patients with history of mental depression, as they may be subject to further depressive episodes.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Although postural hypotension occurs infrequently, make position changes slowly, and in stages, particularly from recumbent
            to upright position, and dangle and move legs a few minutes before standing. Lie down immediately if faintness or dizziness
            occurs.
         </li>
<li>Avoid potentially hazardous activities until reaction to drug has been determined due to possible sedative effects.</li>
<li>Do not omit doses or stop the drug without consulting the physician.</li>
<li>Do not take OTC medications, alcohol, or other CNS depressants without prior discussion with physician.</li>
<li>Examine site when transdermal patch is removed and report to physician if erythema, rash, irritation, or hyperpigmentation
            occurs.
         </li>
<li>If transdermal patch loosens, tape it in place with adhesive. The patch should never be cut or trimmed.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
