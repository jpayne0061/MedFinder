<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Selective inhibition of alpha<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors; produces vasodilation in both resistance (arterioles) and capacitance (veins) vessels with the result that
         both peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure are reduced.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Lowers blood pressure in supine and standing positions with most pronounced effect on diastolic pressure. Minor effect on
         heart rate and cardiac output in the supine position and does not increase plasma renin activity. Tolerance to antihypertensive
         effect rarely occurs. Effective when used concomitantly with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent and a thiazide diuretic. Infrequently
         used in monotherapy because of tendency to support sodium and water retention resulting in increased plasma volume.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give initial dose at bedtime to reduce possibility of adverse effects such as postural hypotension and syncope. However, if
            first dose is taken during the day, advise patient not to drive a car for about 4 h after ingestion of drug.
         </li>
<li>Give drug with food to reduce incidence of faintness and dizziness; food may delay absorption but does not affect extent of
            absorption.
         </li>
<li>Store in tightly closed container away from strong light. Do not freeze.</li>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Be alert for first-dose phenomenon (rare adverse effect: 0.15% of patients); characterized by a precipitous decline in
            BP, bradycardia, and consciousness disturbances (syncope) within 90120 min after the initial dose of prazosin. Recovery
            is usually within several hours. Preexisting low plasma volume (from diuretic therapy or salt restriction), beta-adrenergic
            therapy, and recent stroke appear to increase the risk of this phenomenon.
         </li>
<li>Monitor blood pressure. If it falls precipitously with first dose, notify physician promptly.</li>
<li>Full therapeutic effect may not be achieved until 46 wk of therapy.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid situations that would result in injury if you should faint, particularly during early phase of treatment. In most cases,
            effect does not recur after initial period of therapy; however, it may occur during acute febrile episodes, when drug dose
            is increased, or when another antihypertensive drug is added to the medication regimen.
         </li>
<li>Make position and direction changes slowly and in stages. Dangle legs and move ankles a minute or so before standing when
            arising in the morning or after a nap.
         </li>
<li>Lie down immediately if you experience light-headedness, dizziness, a sense of impending loss of consciousness, or blurred
            vision. Attempting to stand or walk may result in a fall.
         </li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until response to drug is known.</li>
<li>Take drug at same time(s) each day. Keep a daily record noting BP and time taken, when medication was taken, which arm was
            used, position (i.e., standing, sitting), and time of day. Take this record to physician for reference at checkup appointment.
         </li>
<li>Report priapism or impotence. A change in the drug regimen usually reverses these difficulties. Since acute episodes of priapism
            followed by impotence spontaneously occur in men with sickle cell anemia, another antihypertensive should be selected. In
            these patients, drug-induced priapism is frequently irreversible.
         </li>
<li>Do not take OTC medications, especially those that may contain an adrenergic agent (e.g., remedies for coughs, colds, allergy),
            without consulting physician.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that adverse effects usually disappear with continuation of therapy, but dosage reduction may be necessary.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
