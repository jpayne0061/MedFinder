<p>When a small amount of alcohol is ingested, a complex of highly unpleasant symptoms known as the disulfiram reaction occurs,
         which serves as a deterrent to further drinking.

<li>Give daily dose in the morning when the resolve not to drink may be strongest.</li>
<li>Give at bedtime to minimize sedative effect of the drug. Decrease in dose may also reduce sedative effect.</li>
<li>Make sure patient has abstained from alcohol and alcohol-containing preparations for at least 12 h and preferably 48 h before
            initiating therapy.
         </li>
<li>Determine compliance periodically. Maintenance therapy may be required for months or even years.</li>
<li>Store at 15°30° C (59°86° F) unless otherwise directed. Protect tablets from light.</li>

<ul>
<li>Do a complete physical examination and careful drug history prior to initiation of therapy.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Baseline and follow-up transaminase studies every 1014 d to detect hepatic dysfunction, and perform CBC and
            sequential multiple analysis (SMA-12) tests every 6 mo.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Disulfiram reaction occurs within 510 min following ingestion of alcohol and may last 30 min to several hours. Intensity
            of reaction varies with each individual, but is generally proportional to the amount of alcohol ingested.
            						
         </li>
<li>Treat patient with severe disulfiram reaction as though in shock. Monitor potassium levels, especially if patient has diabetes
            mellitus.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Understand fully the possible dangers if alcohol is ingested during disulfiram treatment before consenting to therapy.</li>
<li>Report promptly to physician the onset of nausea with right upper quadrant pain or discomfort, itching, jaundiced sclerae
            or skin, dark urine, clay-colored stools. Withhold drug pending liver function tests.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Ingestion of even small amounts of alcohol or use of external applications that contain alcohol may be sufficient to produce
            a reaction. Read all labels and avoid use of anything containing alcohol.
            						
         </li>
<li>Prolonged administration of disulfiram does not produce tolerance; the longer the therapy, the higher the sensitivity to alcohol.</li>
<li>Alcohol sensitivity may last as long as 2 wk after disulfiram has been discontinued.</li>
<li>
            							Note: Adverse effects of drug are often experienced during first 2 wk of therapy; symptoms usually disappear with continued therapy
            or with dose reduction.
            						
         </li>
<li>Carry an identification card stating you are on disulfiram therapy and describing the symptoms of disulfiram reaction. Also
            provide the name of the physician or institution to contact in an emergency.
         </li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until response to drug is known.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
