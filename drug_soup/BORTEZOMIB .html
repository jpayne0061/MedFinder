<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of proteasome that is responsible for regulation of protein expression and degradation
         of damaged or obsolete proteins within the cell; its activity is critical to activation or suppression of cellular functions
         including the cell cycle, oncogene expression, and apoptosis. Inhibition of breakdown of proteasome proteins has been associated
         with sensitization of the cell to apoptosis. Malignant cells are much more sensitive to the effects of proteasome inhibition
         than normal cells.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Proteasome inhibition may reverse some of the changes that allow proliferation of malignant cells and suppress apoptosis (programmed
         cell death) in malignant cells.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in patients who have failed one prior therapy.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron, or mannitol; pregnancy (category D); lactation. Safety and effectiveness in children
         are not established.
      </p>
