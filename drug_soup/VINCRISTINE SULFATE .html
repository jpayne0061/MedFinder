<p>1 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Cell cycle-specific vinca alkaloid (obtained from periwinkle plant <i>Vinca rosea</i>); analog of vinblastine. Arrests mitosis at metaphase, thereby, inhibiting cell division. Antineoplastic mechanism unclear.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>In contrast to vinblastine, exhibits relatively low toxic effect on normal cells and thus produces minimal myelosuppression;
         however, neurologic and neuromuscular effects are more severe.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Acute lymphoblastic and other leukemias, Hodgkin's disease, lymphosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, lung and breast cancer,
         reticular cell carcinoma, and osteogenic and other sarcomas.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, alone or adjunctively with other antineoplastics.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Obstructive jaundice; pregnancy (category D), lactation, men and women of childbearing potential; patient with demyelinating
         form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Leukopenia; preexisting neuromuscular disease; hypertension; infection; patients receiving drugs with neurotoxic potential.</p>

                  Vincristine is available in solution form, which does not require reconstitution. Avoid contact with eyes. Severe irritation
                  and persisting corneal changes may occur. Flush immediately and thoroughly with copious amounts of water. Wash both eyes;
                  do not assume one eye escaped contamination.

                  Use applications of moderate heat and local injection of hyaluronidase to help disperse extravasated drug. Restart infusion
                  in another vein. Observe injection site for sloughing.

<ul>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O ratio and pattern, BP, and temperature daily.</li>
<li>Weigh patient under standard conditions weekly or more often if ordered. In the presence of edema or ascites, patient's ideal
            weight is used to determine dosage. Report a steady gain or sudden weight change to physician.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Monitor serum electrolytes and CBC with differential. Complete bone marrow remission in leukemia varies widely
            and may not occur for as long as 100 d after therapy is started.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that neuromuscular adverse effects, most apt to appear in the patient with preexisting neuromuscular disease, usually
            disappear after 6 wk of treatment. Children are especially susceptible to neuromuscular adverse effects.
         </li>
<li>Assess for hand muscular weakness, and check deep tendon reflexes (depression of Achilles reflex is the earliest sign of neuropathy).
            Also observe for and report promptly: Mental depression, ptosis, double vision, hoarseness, paresthesias, neuritic pain, and
            motor difficulties.
         </li>
<li>Provide special protection against infection or injury during leukopenic days. Leukopenia occurs in a significant number of
            patients; leukocyte count in children usually reaches nadir on fourth day and begins to rise on fifth day after drug administration.
         </li>
<li>Avoid use of rectal thermometer or intrusive tubing to prevent injury to rectal mucosa.</li>
<li>Check patient's ability to ambulate and supply support if necessary. Walking may be impaired.</li>
<li>Take care to distinguish between the depression associated with realization of neoplastic disease and that which is drug-induced.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Notify physician promptly of stomach, bone, or joint pain, and swelling of lower legs and ankles.</li>
<li>Start a prophylactic regimen against constipation and paralytic ileus (adequate fluids, high-fiber diet, laxatives) at beginning
            of treatment and report changes in bowel habit to health care providers as soon as manifested (paralytic ileus is most likely
            to occur in young children).
         </li>
<li>Reversible hair loss is reportedly the most common adverse reaction and may persist for the duration of therapy. Regrowth
            may start before end of treatment. This is a distressing adverse effect because the scalp hair will drop out in large clumps.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
