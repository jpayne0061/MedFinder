<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75% injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Anesthetic of the amide type. Decreases sodium flux into nerve cell, inhibiting initial depolarization, and prevents propagation
         and conduction of the nerve impulse. Progression of anesthesia, related to diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity
         of affected fibers is manifested clinically as sequential loss of nerve function. May stimulate or depress the CNS or do both.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Primary depressant effect is in medulla and higher centers affecting patient's reaction to pain, temperature, and touch, as
         well as proprioception and skeletal muscle tone.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Infiltration anesthesia; peripheral, sympathetic nerve, and epidural (including caudal) block anesthesia; 0.75% bupivacaine
         solution in dextrose is used for spinal anesthesia.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Known sensitivity to bupivacaine, local anesthetics, other amide-type anesthetics. Parabens, or metabisulfites; acidosis;
         heart block; severe hemorrhage; hypotension and shock; hypertension, cerebrospinal diseases; obstetrical paracervical anesthesia
         or spinal anesthesia in septicemia; topical or IV regional anesthesia; intercurrent use with chloroprocaine; history of malignant
         hyperthermia. Safety during pregnancy (category C) other than during labor, lactation, or children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Older adults or debilitated patients; hepatic or renal disease; known drug allergies and sensitivities; dysrhythmias; children
         &gt;12 y; obstetrical delivery.

<ul>
<li>Monitor for signs of inadvertent intravascular injection, which can produce a transient "epinephrine response" (increased
            heart rate or systolic BP or both, circumoral pallor, palpitations, nervousness) within 45 seconds in the unsedated patient
            and an increase by 20 bpm or more in heart rate for at least 15 seconds in sedated patient.
         </li>
<li>Vasoconstrictor-containing solution should be administered cautiously, if at all, to areas with end arteries (e.g., digits,
            penis) or to areas that have a compromised blood supply; ischemia and gangrene can result. Inspect areas for evidence of reduced
            perfusion because of vasospasm: pale, cold, sensitive skin.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Systemic reactions (toxicity) are more apt to occur in children or older adults and may develop rapidly or be delayed for
            as long as 30 min after administration.
            						
         </li>
<li>Monitor for toxicity: CNS stimulation (unusual anxiety, excitement, restlessness) usually occurs first, followed by CNS depression
            (drowsiness, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest). However, because stimulation is apt to be transient or absent, drowsiness
            may be the first sign in some patients (especially children and older adults).
         </li>
<li>Monitor BP and fetal heart rate continuously during labor because maternal hypotension may accompany regional anesthesia.
            Place mother on left side with legs elevated.
         </li>
<li>Monitor cardiac and respiratory status continuously in patients receiving retrobulbar and dental blocks.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>After spinal anesthesia, sensation to lower extremities may not return for 2.53.5 h.</li>
