<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>0.1 mg, 0.25 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Principal alkaloid of <i>Rauwolfia serpentina.</i> Interferes with binding of serotonin at receptor sites, decreases synthesis of norepinephrine by depleting dopamine (its
         precursor), and competitively inhibits their reuptake in storage granules. Depletes norepinephrine and serotonin in CNS, peripheral
         nervous system, heart, and other organs and tissues.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Sympathetic inhibition seen in small but persistent decrease in BP, frequently associated with bradycardia, and reduced cardiac
         output. Central effect results in tranquilization and sedation similar to that produced by chlorpromazine.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Mild essential hypertension and as adjunctive therapy with other antihypertensive agents in the more severe forms of hypertension.
         Also used in agitated psychotic states, primarily in patients intolerant to phenothiazine or patients who also require antihypertensive
         medication.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Reduce vasospastic attacks in Raynaud's phenomenon and other peripheral vascular disorders, and for short-term symptomatic
         treatment of thyrotoxicosis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to rauwolfia alkaloids; history of mental depression; acute peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis; patients receiving
         electroconvulsive therapy; within 714 d of MAO inhibitor therapy. Safe use during pregnancy (category D) or lactation
         is not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Renal insufficiency; cardiac arrhythmias; cardiac damage; cerebrovascular accident; epilepsy; bronchitis, asthma; older adults,
         debilitated patients; gallstones; obesity; chronic sinusitis; parkinsonism; pheochromocytoma.

            directed by manufacturer.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Assess vital signs at intervals prescribed by physician. Compare readings with baseline data and keep physician informed.
            (Note: Drop in BP may be accompanied by bradycardia.)
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Periodic CBC with differential, platelet count, serum electrolytes, and plasma glucose.</li>
<li>Supervise ambulation as indicated; postural hypotension occurs rarely with usual PO doses but is not uncommon in patients
            receiving large parenteral doses.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O, especially in patients with impaired kidney function. Report changes in I&amp;O ratio and pattern.</li>
<li>Full therapeutic effect of oral drug for hypertension may not occur until 23 wk of therapy, and effects may persist
            for as long as 46 wk after drug is discontinued.
         </li>
<li>Take special precautions with older adult and obese patients (half-life is reportedly prolonged in obese patients). Anticipate
            increased incidence of adverse effects.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that mental depression is a serious adverse effect and may be severe. It occurs most commonly in high dosage regimens
            (e.g., 0.51 mg/d or more) and may not appear until 28 mo of therapy and may last for several months after drug
            is withdrawn.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Take drug at the same time each day, do not to skip or double doses, and do not to stop therapy without advice of physician.</li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in potentially hazardous activities until response to drug is known.</li>
<li>Learn about possible adverse effects and report promptly to physician.</li>
<li>Report the following possible beginning symptoms of depression: early morning insomnia, anorexia, inability to concentrate,
            despondency, self-deprecation, attitude of detachment, mood swings, or impotence. Hospitalization may be necessary.
         </li>
<li>Make position changes slowly, particularly from recumbent to upright posture, and lie down or sit down (head-low position)
            if patient feels faint. Do not take hot showers or hot tub baths, and do not to stand still for prolonged periods. Report
            symptoms of dizziness or light-headedness to physician.
         </li>
<li>Check for edema and record weight daily to help make a distinction between weight gain from edema and that from increased
            appetite. Consult physician about gain of 12 kg (35 lb) in 1 wk.
         </li>
<li>Do not take OTC medications without consulting physician or pharmacist (many preparations for coughs and colds contain adrenergic
            agents that affect the actions of rauwolfia alkaloids).
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
