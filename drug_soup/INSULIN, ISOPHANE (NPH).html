<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>100 units/mL</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Intermediate-acting, cloudy suspension of zinc insulin crystals modified by protamine in a neutral buffer. NPH Iletin II (pork),
         and Insulatard NPH are "purified" or "single component" insulins that have been purified and are less likely
         to cause allergic reactions than nonpurified preparations.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Lowers blood glucose levels by increasing peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat tissue, and by
         inhibiting the liver from changing glycogen to glucose. Therapeutic effect controls postprandial hyperglycemia, usually without
         supplemental doses of insulin injection.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Used to control hyperglycemia in the diabetic patient. Mixtard and Novolin 70/30 are fixed combinations of purified regular
         insulin 30% and NPH 70%.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>During episodes of hypoglycemia or in patients sensitive to any ingredient in the formulation.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>In insulin resistant patients, hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism; lactation, older adults, pregnancy (category B), renal or
         hepatic impairment. Safety and efficacy in children

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Subcutaneous</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give isophane insulin 30 min before first meal of the day. If necessary, a second smaller dose may be prescribed 30 min before
            supper or at bedtime.
         </li>
<li>Ensure complete dispersion by mixing thoroughly by gently rotating vial between palms and inverting it end to end several
            times. Do not shake.
         </li>
<li>Do <small>NOT</small> mix insulins unless prescribed by physician. In general, when insulin injection (regular insulin) is to be combined, it is
            drawn first.
         </li>
<li>
            				Note: Isophane insulin may be mixed with insulin injection without altering either solution. Do <small>NOT</small> mix with Lente forms.
            			
         </li>
<li>Store unopened vial at 2°8° C (36°46° F). Avoid freezing and exposure to extremes in temperature
            or to direct sunlight.
         </li>

<ul>
<li>Suspect hypoglycemia if fatigue, weakness, sweating, tremor, or nervousness occur.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>If insulin was given before breakfast, a hypoglycemic episode is most likely to occur between mid-afternoon and dinnertime,
            when insulin effect is peaking. Advise to eat a snack in mid-afternoon and to carry sugar or candy to treat a reaction. A
            snack at bedtime will prevent insulin reaction during the night.
         </li>
<li>Learn the S&amp;S of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia (see Appendix F).</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
