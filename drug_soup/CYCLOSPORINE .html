<p><b>Sandimmune:</b> 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg capsules; 100 mg/mL oral solution
      </p>
<p><b>Gengraf, Neoral:</b> (microemulsion) 25 mg, 100 mg capsules; 100 mg/mL oral solution; 50 mg/mL injection

<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Immunosuppressant agent derived from extract of a soil fungus. Action in reducing transplant rejection appears to be due to
         selective and reversible inhibition of helper T-lymphocytes (which normally stimulate antibody production).
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>This creates an imbalance in favor of suppressor T-lymphocytes (which inhibit antibody production); thus immune response is
         subdued. Unlike other immunosuppressive agents, it does not cause clinically significant bone marrow suppression.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>In conjunction with adrenal corticosteroids to prevent organ rejection after kidney, liver, and heart transplants (allografts).
         Has had limited use in pancreas, bone marrow, and heart/lung transplantations. Also used for treatment of chronic transplant
         rejection in patients previously treated with other immunosuppressants; rheumatoid arthritis, severe psoriasis. Ophthalmic
         emulsion for the treatment of keratoconjunctivitis sicca.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Sjögren's syndrome, to prevent rejection of heart-lung and pancreatic transplants, ulcerative colitis.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>

         oil); recent contact with or bout of chickenpox, herpes zoster; administration of live virus vaccines to patient or family
         members; RA patients with abnormal renal function, uncontrolled hypertension, or malignancies; ocular infection, pregnancy
         (category C), lactation.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Observe patients receiving the drug parenterally for at least 30 min continuously after start of IV infusion, and at frequent
            intervals thereafter to detect allergic or other adverse reactions.
         </li>
<li>Hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with Cremophor emulsifying agent in the parenteral formulation but not with
            the PO solution, which does not contain this ingredient.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O ratio and pattern: Nephrotoxicity has been reported in about one third of transplant patients. It has occurred
            in mild forms as late as 23 mo after transplantation. In severe form, it can be irreversible, and therefore early recognition
            is critical.
         </li>
<li>Monitor vital signs. Be alert to indicators of local or systemic infection that can be fungal, viral, or bacterial. Also report
            significant rise in BP.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Baseline and periodic tests are advised for (1) renal function (BUN, serum creatinine), (2) liver function (AST,
            ALT, serum amylase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase), and (3) serum potassium.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: In psoriasis patients, CBC, BUN, uric acid, potassium, lipids, and magnesium should be monitored biweekly during
            first 3 mo.
         </li>
<li>Periodic tests should be made of neurologic function. Neurotoxic effects generally occur over 13195 d after initiation
            of cyclosporine therapy. Signs and symptoms are reportedly fully reversible with dosage reduction or discontinuation of drug.
         </li>
<li>Monitor blood or plasma drug concentrations at regular intervals, particularly in patients receiving the drug orally for prolonged
            periods, as drug absorption is erratic.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the specially calibrated pipette provided to measure dose.</li>
<li>Take medication with meals to reduce nausea or GI irritation.</li>
<li>Enhance palatability of oral solution by mixing it with milk, chocolate milk, or orange juice, preferably at room temperature.
            Mix in a glass rather than a plastic container. Stir well, drink immediately, and rinse glass with small quantity of diluent
            to assure getting entire dose.
         </li>
<li>Take medication at same time each day to maintain therapeutic blood levels.</li>
<li>Keep scheduled follow-up appointments.</li>
<li>If possible, see a dentist before start of cyclosporine treatment, and practice good oral hygiene. Inspect mouth daily for
            white patches, sores, swollen gums.
         </li>
<li>Hirsutism is reversible with discontinuation of drug.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
