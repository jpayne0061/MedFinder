<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>10 mg capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Long-acting alpha-adrenergic blocking agent. Apparently produces noncompetitive blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptor sites
         at postganglionic synapse. Alpha-receptor sites are thus unable to react to endogenous or exogenous sympathomimetic agents.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Blocks excitatory effects of epinephrine, including vasoconstriction, but does not affect adrenergic cardiac inhibitory actions.
         It produces a "chemical sympathectomy" and it can maintain it. Causes orthostatic hypotension in both normotensive
         and hypertensive patients.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Management of pheochromocytoma.</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>To improve circulation in peripheral vasospastic conditions such as Raynaud's acrocyanosis and frostbite sequelae, for adjunctive
         treatment of shock, hypertensive crisis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Instances when fall in BP would be dangerous; compensated congestive heart failure; pregnancy (category C), lactation.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Marked cerebral or coronary arteriosclerosis, CHF; renal insufficiency; respiratory infections.</p>

<ul>
<li>Monitor BP and note pulse quality, rate, and rhythm in recumbent and standing positions during period of dosage adjustment.
            Observe patient closely for at least 4 d from one dosage increment to the next; hypotension and tachycardia are most likely
            to occur in standing position.
         </li>
<li>Drug has cumulative action, thus onset of therapeutic effects may not occur until after 2 wk of therapy, and full therapeutic
            effects may not be apparent for several more weeks.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Make position changes slowly, particularly from reclining to upright posture, and dangle legs and exercise ankles and feet
            for a few minutes before standing.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that light headedness, dizziness, and palpitations usually disappear with continued therapy but may reappear under
            conditions that promote vasodilation, such as strenuous exercise or ingestion of a large meal or alcohol.
         </li>
<li>Pupil constriction, nasal stuffiness, and inhibition of ejaculation generally decrease with continued therapy.</li>
<li>Do not take OTC medications for coughs, colds, or allergy without approval of physician. Many contain agents that cause BP
            elevation.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
