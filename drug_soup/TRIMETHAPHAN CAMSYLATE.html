<p>50 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Potent, short-acting ganglionic blocking agent. Blocks transmission in both adrenergic and cholinergic ganglia by competing
         with acetylcholine for receptor sites on postganglionic membranes. Adrenergic blockade results in vasodilation, improved peripheral
         blood flow, and thus decrease in BP.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Direct peripheral vasodilation action produces marked hypotension. BP is significantly lower in head-up position because venous
         dilation and peripheral pooling reduce cardiac output.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>To produce controlled hypotension for certain surgical procedures (e.g., neurologic, ophthalmic, and plastic surgery) and
         for short-term treatment of hypertensive crises associated with pulmonary edema.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Acute dissecting aneurysm of aorta and ischemic heart disease.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Anemia, hypovolemia, shock; asphyxia, respiratory insufficiency; glaucoma; pregnancy (category X), lactation.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>History of allergy; older adults and debilitated patients, children; cardiac disease, arteriosclerosis; liver or kidney disease;
         degenerative CNS disease; Addison's disease; diabetes mellitus; patients receiving steroids, antihypertensives, anesthetics
         (especially spinal), and diuretics.

<ul>
<li>Assess vital signs prior to initiation of therapy as a baseline for comparison during drug administration.</li>
<li>Observe continuously while receiving infusion. Check BP q2min until stabilized at desired level, then q5min for duration of
            treatment. Monitor pulse and respiration closely.
         </li>
<li>Intensity of hypotensive effect is largely dependent on positioning. Decrease in BP is most marked in sitting or standing
            position.
         </li>
<li>Continue to monitor vital signs at regular intervals after completion of treatment. Since BP returns to pretreatment level
            within 10 min after the infusion is terminated, an oral antihypertensive is usually initiated as soon as desired BP level
            has been achieved.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O. Ganglionic blockade may reduce renal blood flow initially as well as voiding contractions and urge to void. Check
            lower abdomen for bladder distension.
         </li>
<li>Notify physician promptly if BP fails to respond. Some patients become refractory to trimethaphan (tachyphylaxis) within 48
            h after initiation of therapy.
         </li>
