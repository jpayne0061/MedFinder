<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Synthetic derivative of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent of marijuana <i>(Cannabis sativa)</i>. Mechanism unclear: Inhibits vomiting through control mechanism in the medulla oblongata, producing potent antiemetic effect;
         nontherapeutic actions are exactly like those of marijuana. Has complex CNS effect that necessitates close supervision of
         the patient during drug use. Decreases REM sleep; effect on BP is unpredictable; oral temperature may be decreased, and heart
         rate may be increased. Risk of drug abuse is high.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Drug produces potent antiemetic effect and is used to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>To treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients who fail to respond to conventional antiemetic therapy.

<ul>
<li>Monitor patients with hypertension or heart disease for BP and cardiac status.</li>
<li>Response to dronabinol is varied, and previous uneventful use does not guarantee that adverse reactions will not occur. Effects
            of drug may persist an unpredictably long time (days). Extended use at therapeutic dosage may cause accumulation of toxic
            amounts of dronabinol and its metabolites.
         </li>
<li>Watch for disturbing psychiatric symptoms if dose is increased: Altered mental state, loss of coordination, evidence of a
            psychologic high (easy laughing, elation and heightened awareness), or depression.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Abrupt withdrawal is associated with symptoms (within 12 h) of irritability, insomnia, restlessness. Peak intensity occurs
            at about 24 h: Hot flashes, diaphoresis, rhinorrhea, watery diarrhea, hiccups, anorexia. Usually, syndrome is over in 96 h.

<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not drive or engage in other potentially hazardous activities that require alertness and judgment because of high incidence
            of dizziness and drowsiness.
         </li>
<li>Understand potential (reversible) for drug-induced mood or behavior changes that may occur during dronabinol use.</li>
<li>Do not ingest alcohol during period of systemic dronabinol effect. Effect on blood ethanol levels is complex and unpredictable.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
