<li>Saturate scalp as well as hair with the lotion; this is not a shampoo.</li>
<li>Hair should be washed with regular shampoo before treatment with permethrin, thoroughly rinsed and dried.</li>
<li>Shake lotion well before application. One container holds enough for at least one treatment, but two containers may be necessary
            if patient has long hair.
         </li>
<li>Rinse hair and scalp thoroughly and dry with a clean towel following 10 min exposure to the medication. Head lice are usually
            eliminated with one treatment.
         </li>
<li>Store drug away from heat at 15°25° C (59°77° F) and direct light. Avoid freezing.</li>

<ul>
<li>Do not attempt therapy if patient is known to be sensitive to any pyrethrin or pyrethroid. Stop treatment if a reaction occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>When hair is dry, comb with a fine-tooth comb (furnished with medication) to remove dead lice and remaining nits or nit shells.</li>
<li>Be aware that drug remains on hair shaft up to 14 d; therefore, recurrence of infestation rarely occurs (
         </li><li>Inspect hair shafts daily for at least 1 wk to determine drug effectiveness. Contact physician if live lice are observed after
            7 d. A renewed prescription for a second treatment may be ordered. Signs of inadequate treatment: Itching, redness of skin,
            skin abrasion, infected scalp areas.
         </li>
<li>Resume regular shampooing after treatment; residual deposit of drug on hair is not reduced.</li>
<li>Be aware that drug is usually irritating to the eyes and mucosa. Flush well with water if medicine accidentally gets into
            eyes.
         </li>
