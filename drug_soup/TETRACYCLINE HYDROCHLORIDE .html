<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>100 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg capsules; 250 mg, 500 mg tablets; 125 mg/mL suspension; 2.2 mg/mL topical solution; 3% ointment</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Broad spectrum antibiotic derived from <i>Streptomyces aureofaciens</i> or produced semisynthetically from oxytetracycline. Tetracyclines usually are bacteriostatic but may be bactericidal in high
         concentrations. Exerts antiacne action by suppressing growth of <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i> within sebaceous follicles, thereby reducing free fatty acid content in sebum. Free fatty acids are thought to be largely
         responsible for inflammatory skin lesions (papules, pustules, cysts) and comedones of acne.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Effective against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and against most <i>chlamydiae, mycoplasmas, rickettsiae,</i> and certain protozoa (e.g., amebae). Exerts antiacne action by suppressing growth of <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i> within sebaceous follicles.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Chlamydial infections (e.g., lymphogranuloma venereum, psittacosis, trachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis, nongonococcal urethritis);
         mycoplasmal infections (e.g., <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i>); rickettsial infections (e.g., Q fever, Rocky Mt spotted fever, typhus); spirochetal infections: relapsing fever <i>(Borrelia),</i> leptospirosis, syphilis (penicillin-hypersensitive patients); amebiases; uncommon gram-negative bacterial infections [e.g.,
         brucellosis, shigellosis, cholera, gonorrhea (penicillin-hypersensitive patients), granuloma inguinale, tularemia]; gram-positive

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give with a full glass of water on an empty stomach at least 1 h before or 2 h after meals (food, milk, and milk products
            can reduce absorption by 50% or more).
         </li>
<li>Do not give immediately before bed.</li>
<li>Give with food if patient is having GI symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, anorexia); do not give with foods high in calcium
            such as milk or milk products.
         </li>
<li>Shake suspension well before pouring to ensure uniform distribution of drug. Use calibrated liquid measure to dispense.</li>
<li>Consult physician about ordering the oral suspension formulation if patient cannot swallow pills.</li>
<li>Check expiration date for all tetracyclines. Fanconi-like syndrome (renal tubular dysfunction) and also an LE-like syndrome
            have been attributed to outdated tetracycline preparations.
         </li>
<li>Tetracycline decomposes with age, exposure to light, and when improperly stored under conditions of extreme humidity, heat,
            or cold. The resultant product may be toxic.
         </li>
<li>Store at 15°30° C (59°86° F) in tightly covered container in dry place. Protect from light.</li>
</ul><span class="adminroutetype">Intramuscular</span><br/><ul>
<li>Ask patient if he is allergic to any of the "caine" local anesthetics. (Tetracycline for IM use contains 40 mg procaine
            HCl per vial.)
         </li>
<li>Reconstitute powder by adding 2 mL sterile water for injection or NS injection to 100- or 250-mg vial.</li>
<li>Give injection deep into body of a relatively large muscle mass (e.g., gluteus maximus or midlateral thigh). Alternate injection
            sites and observe daily for irritation and swelling.
         </li>
<li>Forewarn patient that IM administration may cause local irritation and is extremely painful.</li>
<li>Store solution at room temperature. Discard after 24 h (directions may vary with manufacturer).</li>

<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Obtain baseline and periodic C&amp;S tests to confirm susceptibility of infecting organism to tetracycline. Also, preform
            initial and periodic kidney, liver, and hematopoietic function tests, particularly during high-dose, long-term therapy. Determine
            serum tetracycline levels in patients at-risk for hepatotoxicity (sometimes associated with pancreatitis and occurs most frequently
            in patients receiving other hepatotoxic drugs or with history of renal or hepatic impairment).
         </li>
<li>Report GI symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) to physician. These are generally dose-dependent, occurring mostly with
            oral forms in patients receiving 2 g/d or more and during prolonged therapy. Frequently, symptoms are controlled by reducing
            dosage or administering with compatible foods.
         </li>
<li>Be alert to evidence of superinfections (see Appendix F). Regularly inspect tongue and mucous membrane of mouth for candidiasis
            (thrush). Suspect superinfection if patient complains of irritation or soreness of mouth, tongue, throat, vagina, or anus,
            or persistent itching of any area, diarrhea, or foul-smelling excreta or discharge.
         </li>
<li>Withhold drug and notify physician if superinfection develops. Superinfections occur most frequently in patients receiving
            prolonged therapy, the debilitated, or those who have diabetes, leukemia, systemic LE, or lymphoma. Women taking oral contraceptives
            reportedly are more susceptible to vaginal candidiasis.
         </li>
<li>Obtain follow-up cultures from all gonococcal infection sites 37 d after completion of tetracycline therapy to verify
            eradication of infection.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O in patients receiving parenteral tetracycline. Report oliguria or any changes in appearance of urine or in I&amp;O.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report onset of diarrhea to physician. It is important to determine whether diarrhea is due to irritating drug effect or superinfections
            or pseudomembranous colitis (caused by overgrowth of toxin-producing bacteria: <i>Clostridium difficile</i>) (see Appendix F). The latter two conditions can be <b>
<small>LIFE THREATENING</small>
</b> and require immediate withdrawal of tetracycline and prompt initiation of symptomatic and supportive therapy.
         </li>
<li>Reduce incidence of superinfection (see Appendix F) by meticulous care of mouth, skin, and perineal area. Rinse mouth of food
            debris after eating; floss daily and use a soft-bristled toothbrush. Wash hands several times a day, particularly after each
            bowel movement and before eating.
         </li>
<li>Avoid direct exposure to sunlight during and for several days after therapy is terminated to reduce possibility of photosensitivity
            reaction (appearing like an exaggerated sunburn, it begins a few minutes to hours following sun exposure, often with tingling,
            burning sensation).
         </li>
<li>Report onset of severe headache or visual disturbances immediately. These are possible symptoms of increased intracranial
            pressure and necessitate prompt withdrawal of tetracycline to prevent irreversible loss of vision.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Tetracycline therapy for brucellosis or spirochetal infections may cause a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. The reaction is usually
            mild and appears abruptly within 624 h after initiation of therapy. It is manifested by malaise, fever, chills, headache,
            adenopathy, leukocytosis, exacerbation of skin lesions, arthralgia, transient hypotension. Treatment is symptomatic; recovery
            generally occurs within 24 h.
            						
         </li>
<li>Report immediately sudden onset of painful or difficult swallowing (dysphagia) to physician. Esophagitis and esophageal ulceration
            have been associated with bedtime administration of tetracycline capsules or tablets with insufficient fluid, particularly
            to patients with hiatal hernia or esophageal problems.
         </li>
<li>Do not allow topical medication to contact eyes, nose, or mouth. Be aware that tetracycline may stain clothing.</li>
<li>Clean affected skin area with soap and water; rinse and dry well before application of topical drug.</li>
<li>Report a worsening infection or stinging and burning sensation with topical applications to physician if pronounced.</li>
<li>Skin treated with topical drug will exhibit bright yellow to green fluorescence under ultraviolet light and "black light."</li>
<li>Be aware that topicycline contains a sulfite that can cause an allergic reaction (itching, wheezing, anaphylaxis) in susceptible
            persons (e.g., asthmatics or allergic individuals).
         </li>
<li>Response to acne therapy usually requires 28 wk, maximal results may not be apparent for up to 12 wk.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking/using this drug.</li>
