<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>100 mg capsules; 50 mg/mL injection; 8% gel</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Steroid hormone synthesized and released by testes, ovary, adrenal cortex, and placenta. Estrogenic, anabolic, and androgenic
         activity. Physiologic precursor to estrogens, androgens, and adrenocortical steroids. Transforms endometrium from proliferative
         to secretory state; suppresses pituitary gonadotropin secretion, thereby blocking follicular maturation and ovulation. Acting
         with estrogen, promotes mammary gland development without causing lactation and increases body temperature 1° F at time
         of ovulation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Relaxes estrogen-primed myometrium and prohibits spontaneous contraction of uterus. Sudden drop in blood levels of progestin
         (and estradiol) causes "withdrawal bleeding" from endometrium. Intrauterine placement of progesterone (intrauterine
         progesterone contraceptive system) hypothetically inhibits sperm survival, and suppresses endometrial proliferation (antiestrogenic
         effect).
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Secondary amenorrhea, functional uterine bleeding, endometriosis, and premenstrual syndrome. As an intrauterine agent (Progestasert)
         and in combination with estrogens provides fertility control. Largely supplanted by new progestins, which have longer action
         and oral effectiveness. Treatment of infertile women with progesterone deficiency.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to progestins, known or suspected breast or genital malignancy; use as a pregnancy test; thrombophlebitis,
         thromboembolic disorders; cerebral apoplexy (or its history); severely impaired liver function or disease; undiagnosed vaginal
         bleeding, missed abortion; use during first 4 mo of pregnancy (category X), lactation. <i>Progestasert:</i> Pregnancy or suspicion of pregnancy. <i>Prometrium</i> (oral): Patients with peanut allergy.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Anemia; diabetes mellitus; history of psychic depression; persons susceptible to acute intermittent porphyria or with conditions
         that may be aggravated by fluid retention (asthma, seizure disorders, cardiac or kidney function, migraine); impaired liver
         function; previous ectopic pregnancy; presence or history of salpingitis; venereal disease; unresolved abnormal Pap smear;
         genital bleeding of unknown etiology; previous pelvic surgery.

<ul>
<li>Record baseline data for comparative value about patient's weight, BP, and pulse at onset of progestin therapy. Report deviations
            promptly.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Periodic liver function tests, blood glucose, and serum electrolytes.</li>
<li>Monitor for and report immediately S&amp;S of thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disease.</li>
<li>Be alert for S&amp;S of acute intermittent porphyria in susceptible patients (e.g., severe, colicky abdominal pain, vomiting,
            distention, diarrhea, constipation).
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid exposure to UV light and prolonged periods of time in the sun. Photosensitivity severity is related to both time of
            exposure and dose. A phototoxic drug reaction usually looks like an exaggerated sunburn and occurs within 518 h after
            exposure to sun and is maximal by 3672 h.
         </li>
<li>Use sunscreen lotion (SPF &gt;12) that contains paraaminobenzoic acid (PABA) on exposed skin surfaces whenever outdoors, even
            on dark days.
         </li>
<li>Inform physician promptly if any of the following occur: Sudden severe headache or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, numbness
            in an arm or leg, pain in calves accompanied by swelling, warmth, and redness; acute chest pain or dyspnea.
         </li>
<li>Report to physician promptly unexplained sudden or gradual, partial or complete loss of vision, ptosis, or diplopia.</li>
<li>Monitor for loss of glycemic control if diabetic.</li>
<li>Notify physician if you become or suspect pregnancy. Learn the potential risk to the fetus from exposure to progestin.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Intrauterine Progesterone Contraceptive System (Progestasert)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Use another method of birth control (foam or condom) during the first 2 mo of Progestasert use.</li>
<li>Regular cyclic pattern of ovulation continues while Progestasert is in place.</li>
<li>Be prepared for heavier and longer menstrual periods during Progestasert use. Consult physician if increased menstrual bleeding
            continues.
         </li>
<li>Check Progestasert threads frequently during first few months and after menstruation (times when expulsion is most likely
            to occur). If you cannot feel threads, return to physician for an examination and prescription for another method of birth
            control.
         </li>
<li>Do not pull on threads for any reason. If the IUD is partially expelled, it should be removed; however, do not try to remove
            it yourself nor allow your partner to attempt to do so.
         </li>
<li>Consult physician if a period is missed and pregnancy is suspected. Remove the device during pregnancy.</li>
<li>Report to the physician for immediate treatment if you experience fever, acute pelvic pain and tenderness, unusual bleeding,
            or severe cramping. These are symptoms that indicate infection.
         </li>
