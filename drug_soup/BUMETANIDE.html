<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg tablets; 0.25 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Sulfonamide derivative structurally related to furosemide and with similar pharmacologic effects. Diuretic activity is 40
         times greater, however, and duration of action is shorter than that of furosemide. Causes both potassium and magnesium wastage.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption by direct action on proximal ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Also appears to
         inhibit phosphate and bicarbonate reabsorption. Produces only mild hypotensive effects at usual diuretic doses.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Edema associated with CHF; hepatic or renal disease, including nephrotic syndrome. Has been used in management of postoperative
         and premenstrual edema, edema accompanying disseminated carcinoma, and mild hypertension. May be used concomitantly with a
         potassium-sparing diuretic.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to bumetanide or to other sulfonamides; anuria, markedly elevated BUN; hepatic coma; severe electrolyte deficiency;
         lactation. Safety during pregnancy (category C) is not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Hepatic cirrhosis, as history of gout; history of hypersensitivity to furosemide.</p>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O and report onset of oliguria or other changes in I&amp;O ratio and pattern promptly.</li>
<li>Monitor weight, BP, and pulse rate. Assess for hypovolemia by taking BP and pulse rate while patient is lying, sitting, and
            standing. Older adults are particularly at risk for hypovolemia with resulting thrombi and emboli.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Serum electrolytes, blood studies, liver and kidney function tests, uric acid (particularly patients with history
            of gout), and blood glucose. Determine values initially and at regular intervals; measurements are especially important in
            patients receiving prolonged treatment, high doses, or who are on sodium restriction.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for S&amp;S of hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia (see Appendix F) especially in those receiving digitalis or who have CHF,
            hepatic cirrhosis, ascites, diarrhea, or potassium-depleting nephropathy.
         </li>
<li>Monitor patients with hepatic disease carefully for fluid and electrolyte imbalances which can precipitate encephalopathy
            (inappropriate behavior, altered mood, impaired judgment, confusion, drowsiness, coma).
         </li>
<li>Question patient about hearing difficulty or ear discomfort. Patients at risk of ototoxic effects include those receiving
            the drug IV, especially at high doses, those with severely impaired renal function, and those receiving other potentially
            ototoxic or nephrotoxic drugs (see Appendix F).
         </li>
<li>Monitor diabetics for loss of glycemic control.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report symptoms of electrolyte imbalance to physician promptly (e.g., weakness, dizziness, fatigue, faintness, confusion,
            muscle cramps, headache, paresthesias).
         </li>
<li>Eat potassium-rich foods such as fruit juices, potatoes, cereals, skim milk, and bananas while taking bumetanide.</li>
<li>Report S&amp;S of ototoxicity promptly to physician (see Appendix F).</li>
<li>Monitor blood glucose for loss of glycemic control if diabetic.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
