<p>1% lotion, shampoo</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Has antibacterial and mild antifungal activity, although mechanism of action and causal relationships is not established.
         Absorption of selenium sulfide into epithelial tissue cells is followed by degradation of compound to selenium and sulfide
         ions. Selenium ions block enzyme systems involved in epithelial cell growth. As a result, rate of turnover in cells with normal
         or higher than normal turnover rates is reduced.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Active against <i>Pityrosporum ovale,</i> a yeast-like fungus found in the normal flora of the scalp. Also decreases rate of growth of the epithelial cells of the
         scalp and other epithelial layers of cells in the body. Utilized in treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and tinea versicolor.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
