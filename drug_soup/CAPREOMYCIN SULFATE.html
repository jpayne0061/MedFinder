<p>1 gm powder for injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Polypeptide antibiotic derived from <i>Streptomyces capreolus.</i> Action mechanism not clear. Cross-resistance between capreomycin and both kanamycin and neomycin has been reported. Bacterial
         resistance can develop rapidly when used alone.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Bacteriostatic against human strains of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and other species of <i>Mycobacterium</i>. Effective second-line antimycobacterial in conjunction with other antitubercular drugs.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Only in conjunction with other appropriate antitubercular drugs in treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis when bactericidal agents,
         e.g., isoniazid and rifampin, cannot be tolerated or when causative organism has become resistant.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Pregnancy (category C), in lactation. Safe use in infants and children not established.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Renal insufficiency (extreme caution); acoustic nerve impairment; history of allergies (especially to drugs); preexisting
         liver disease; myasthenia gravis; parkinsonism.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Intramuscular</span><br/><ul>
<li>Reconstitute by adding 2 mL of NS injection or sterile water for injection to each 1 g vial. Allow 23 min for drug to
            dissolve completely.
         </li>
<li>Make IM injections deep into large muscle mass. Superficial injections are more painful and are associated with sterile abscess.
            Rotate injection sites.
         </li>
<li>Solution may become pale straw color and darken with time, but this does not indicate loss of potency.</li>
<li>After reconstitution, solution may be stored 48 h at room temperature and up to 14 d under refrigeration unless otherwise
            directed.

<ul>
<li>Observe injection sites for signs of excessive bleeding and inflammation.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Perform the following as guidelines for therapy before drug is started and at regular intervals during therapy:
            appropriate bacterial sensitivity tests; CBC; SMA-12 screening weekly; weekly renal function studies (BUN, NPN, creatinine
            clearance, sediment); liver function tests (periodically); serum potassium levels (monthly).
         </li>
<li>Reduce dosage of capreomycin in patients with impaired renal function, as it is cumulative. Follow renal function tests closely.</li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O rates and pattern: Report immediately any change in output or I&amp;O ratio, any unusual appearance of urine, or elevation
            of BUN above 30 mg/dL. (Normal BUN: 1020 mg/dL.)
         </li>
<li>Evaluate hearing and balance by audiometric measurements (twice weekly or weekly) and tests of vestibular function (periodically).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report any change in hearing or disturbance of balance. These effects are sometimes reversible if drug is withdrawn promptly
            when first symptoms appear.
         </li>
<li>Ensure that you know about adverse reactions and what to do about them. Report immediately the appearance of any unusual symptom,
            regardless of how vague it may seem.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
