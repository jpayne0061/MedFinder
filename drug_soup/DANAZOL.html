<ul>
<li>Routine breast examinations should be carried out during therapy. Carcinoma of the breast should be ruled out prior to start
            of therapy for fibrocystic breast disease. Advise patient to report to physician if any nodule enlarges or becomes tender
            or hard during therapy.
         </li>
<li>Because danazol may cause fluid retention, patients with cardiac or renal dysfunction, epilepsy, or migraine should be observed
            closely during therapy, as these problems could worsen. Monitor weight.
         </li>
<li>Drug-induced edema may compress the median nerve, producing symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. If patient complains of wrist
            pain that worsens at night, paresthesias in radial palmar aspect of the hand and fingers, consult physician.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Baseline and periodic liver function tests should be performed in all patients. Patients with diabetes (or history
            of) should have blood glucose tests.
         </li>

<li>
            							Note: Pain and discomfort are usually relieved in 2 or 3 mo; the nodularity in 46 mo. Menses may be regular or irregular in
            pattern during therapy.
            						
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Drug-induced amenorrhea is reversible. Ovulation and cyclic bleeding usually return within 6090 d after therapeutic
            regimen is discontinued as well as the potential for conception.
            						
         </li>
<li>Use a nonhormonal contraceptive during treatment because ovulation may not be suppressed until 68 wk after therapy is
            begun. If pregnancy occurs while taking this drug, discontinue danzol. Continue discussing the question of continuing the
            pregnancy considered.
         </li>
<li>Report voice changes promptly. Stop drug to avoid permanent damage to voice. Virilizing adverse effects may persist even after
            drug therapy is terminated.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
