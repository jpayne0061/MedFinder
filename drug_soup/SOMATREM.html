<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>5 mg (approximately 15 IU), 10 mg (approximately 30 IU) vials</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Biosynthetic product of recombinant DNA technology. Contains exact sequence of 191 amino acids in pituitary-derived human
         growth hormone (GH) plus an amino terminal methionyl group not found in natural GH. In presence of GH deficiency, promotes
         skeletal growth at epiphyseal plates of long bones by increasing levels of the mediator somatomedin-C and by increasing synthesis
         of protein, chondroitin sulfate, and collagen. Increases number and size of muscle cells. May induce GH antibody formation
         (IgG), but effect of antibodies on endogenous GH activity is unknown.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Therapeutically equivalent to natural GH (somatropin) of pituitary origin. Affects metabolism and growth of most body tissues
         including red cell mass, with possible exception of eye and brain.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Long-term treatment of children with growth failure due to deficiency of endogenous GH.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Patient with closed epiphyses; underlying progressive intracranial tumor; pregnancy (category C).</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Diabetes mellitus or family history of the disease; concomitant use of glucocorticoids; concomitant or prior use of thyroid
         or androgens in prepubertal male; hypothyroidism. Patient with known sensitivity to benzyl alcohol; lactation.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Intramuscular/</span><span class="adminroutetype">Subcutaneous</span><br/><ul>
<li>Reconstitute each vial (containing 5 mL lyophilized powder) with 15 mL bacteriostatic water for injection, aiming stream
            of water against vial wall. Swirl vial gently to mix contents. Do not shake.
         </li>
<li>
            				Note: pH of reconstituted solution is about 7.8.
            			
         </li>
<li>Do not use if reconstituted solution is cloudy or has crystals immediately after reconstitution or refrigeration.</li>
<li>Reconstitute with sterile water for injection, USP, when administering to newborns; benzyl alcohol is the preservative in
            bacteriostatic water for injection and may be toxic to this age group.
         </li>
<li>Use disposable syringe small enough to administer prescribed doses with accuracy and needle long enough to ensure injection
            into muscle layer.
         </li>
<li>Discard unused reconstituted solution within 7 d.</li>
<li>Store lyophilized powder and reconstituted solution at 2°8° C (36°46° F). Do not freeze. Expiration
            dates are on labels.
         </li>

<ul>
<li>Assess bone age annually in all patients and especially those also receiving thyroid, androgen, or estrogen replacement therapy,
            since concurrent use of these agents may precipitate early epiphyseal closure. Urge parent to take child for growth assessment
            on appointed annual dates.
         </li>
<li>Evaluate thyroid status at regular intervals. Untreated hypothyroidism may interfere with response to drug.</li>
<li>Observe diabetics or those with family history of diabetes closely. Check blood or urine glucose and HbA<sub>1C</sub> regularly to recognize glucose intolerance.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Be aware that first year growth of 17.5 cm (7 in.) with somatrem has been reported, but average expectations are 7.512.5
            cm (35 in.), slightly less in second year, and after that, normal growth rate. Also, subcutaneous fat diminishes but
            returns to pretreatment level later.
         </li>
<li>Record accurate height measurements at regular intervals and report to physician if rate is less than expected.</li>
<li>Report child's complaints of hip or knee pain or a limp. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur in patients with endocrine
            disorders.
         </li>
