<li>Monitor for therapeutic effectiveness. Desired response may begin within 710 d; however, optimal results take 34
            wk. Reinforce the importance of continuing treatment to patient.
         </li>
<li>Benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotic drugs are withdrawn gradually before buspirone therapy is started. Observe patient for
            rebound symptoms, which may occur over varying time periods during first phase of treatment.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Buspirone may displace digoxin from its serum binding, increasing the potential for toxic serum levels of digoxin. If the
            two drugs must be given concomitantly, monitor cardiovascular parameters (BP, pulse) until dosage has been stabilized.
            						
         </li>
<li>Monitor for and report dystonia, motor restlessness, and involuntary repetitious movement of facial or cervical muscle.</li>
<li>Observe for and report swollen ankles, decreased urinary output, changes in voiding pattern, jaundice, itching, nausea, or
            vomiting.
