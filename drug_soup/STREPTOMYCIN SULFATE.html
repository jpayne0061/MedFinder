<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>400 mg/mL, 1 g injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Aminoglycoside antibiotic derived from <i>Streptomyces griseus,</i> with bactericidal and bacteriostatic actions. Most commonly used concurrently with other antimicrobial agents because of
         rapid emergence of resistant strains when used alone.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Active against a variety of gram-positive, gram-negative, and acid-fast organisms. Reportedly, it is the least nephrotoxic
         of the aminoglycosides.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Only in combination with other antitubercular drugs in treatment of all forms of active tuberculosis caused by susceptible
         organisms. Used alone or in conjunction with tetracycline for tularemia, plague, and brucellosis. Also used with other antibiotics
         in treatment of subacute bacterial endocarditis due to <i>Enterococci</i> and <i>Streptococci</i> (viridans group) and <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> and in treatment of peritonitis, respiratory tract infections, granuloma inguinale, and chancroid when other drugs have failed.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>History of toxic reaction or hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides; labyrinthine disease; myasthenia gravis; concurrent or sequential
         use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic agents; pregnancy (category C); lactation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Impaired kidney function (given in reduced dosages); use in older adults and in prematures, neonates, and children.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Intramuscular</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give IM deep into large muscle mass to minimize possibility of irritation. Injections are painful.</li>
<li>Avoid direct contact with drug; sensitization can occur. Use gloves during preparation of drug.</li>
<li>Use commercially prepared IM solution undiluted; intended only for IM injection (contains a preservative, and therefore is
            not suitable for other routes).
         </li>
<li>Store ampules at room temperature. Protect from light; exposure to light may slightly darken solution, with no apparent loss
            of potency.

<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Obtain C&amp;S tests prior to and periodically during course of therapy. In patients with impaired kidney function,
            frequent determinations of serum drug concentrations and periodic kidney and liver function tests are advised (serum concentrations
            should not exceed 25 mcg/mL in these patients).
         </li>
<li>Be alert for and report immediately symptoms of ototoxicity (see Appendix F). Symptoms are most likely to occur in patients
            with impaired kidney function, patients receiving high doses (1.82 g/d) or other ototoxic or neurotoxic drugs, and older
            adults. Irreversible damage may occur if drug is not discontinued promptly.
         </li>
<li>Early damage to vestibular portion of eighth cranial nerve (higher incidence than auditory toxicity) is initially manifested
            by moderately severe headache, nausea, vomiting, vertigo in upright position, difficulty in reading, unsteadiness, and positive
            Romberg sign.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that auditory nerve damage is usually preceded by vestibular symptoms and high-pitched tinnitus, roaring noises,
            impaired hearing (especially to high-pitched sounds), sense of fullness in ears. Audiometric test should be done if these
            symptoms appear, and drug should be discontinued. Hearing loss can be permanent if damage is extensive. Tinnitus may persist
            several days to weeks after drug is stopped.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O. Report oliguria or changes in I&amp;O ratio (possible signs of diminishing kidney function). Sufficient fluids to
            maintain urinary output of 1500 mL/24 h are generally advised. Consult physician.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report any unusual symptoms. Review adverse reactions with physician periodically, especially with prolonged therapy.</li>
<li>Be aware of possibility of ototoxicity and its symptoms (see Appendix F).</li>
<li>Report to physician immediately any of the following: Nausea, vomiting, vertigo, incoordination, tinnitus, fullness in ears,
            impaired hearing.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
