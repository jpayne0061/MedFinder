<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg tablet; 5 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>The alpha blockade results in vasodilation, decreased peripheral resistance, and orthostatic hypotension and only slightly
         affects cardiac output and coronary artery blood flow. It has beta-blocking effects on the sinus node, AV node, and ventricular
         muscle, which lead to bradycardia, delay in AV conduction, and depression of cardiac contractility.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Acts as an adrenergic receptor blocking agent that combines selective alpha activity and nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking
         actions. Both actions contribute to blood pressure reduction.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Mild, moderate, and severe hypertension. May be used alone or in combination with other anti-hypertensive agents, especially
         thiazide diuretics.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Bronchial asthma; uncontrolled cardiac failure, heart block (greater than first degree), cardiogenic shock, severe bradycardia.
         Safe use during pregnancy (category C), lactation, or in children is not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Nonallergic bronchospastic disease (COPD), well-compensated patients with history of heart failure; pheochromocytoma; impaired
         liver function, jaundice; diabetes mellitus; peripheral vascular disease.

<ul>
<li>Monitor BP and pulse during dosage adjustment period. Use standing BP as indicator for making dosage adjustments for oral
            drugs and assessing patient's tolerance of dosage increases. Take after patient stands for 10 min. Clarify with physician.
         </li>
<li>Monitor BP at 5 min intervals for 30 min after IV administration; then at 30 min intervals for 2 h; then hourly for about
            6 h; and as indicated thereafter.
         </li>
<li>Monitor diabetic patients closely; drug may mask usual cardiovascular response to acute hypoglycemia (e.g., tachycardia).</li>
<li>Convert from IV to PO therapy only when supine diastolic pressure rises about 10 mm Hg.</li>
<li>Maintain patient in supine position for at least 3 h after IV administration. Then determine patient's ability to tolerate
            elevated and upright positions before allowing ambulation. Manage this slowly.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li> 							Note: Postural hypotension is most likely to occur during peak plasma levels (i.e., 24 h after drug administration). 						</li>
<li>Make all position changes slowly and in stages, particularly from lying to upright position. Older adult patients are especially
            sensitive to hypotensive effects.
         </li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until response to drug is known.</li>
<li> 							Note: Most adverse effects (e.g., scalp tingling) are mild, transient, and dose related and occur early in therapy. 						</li>
<li>Be sure to keep follow-up appointments. Get liver and kidney function tests periodically during therapy.</li>
<li>Discontinue drug gradually over 12 wk period after chronic administration. Close monitoring during this time is very
            important.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
