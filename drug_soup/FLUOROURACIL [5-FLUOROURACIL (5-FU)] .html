<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>50 mg/mL injection; 1%, 2%, 5% topical solution; 0.5%, 1%, 5% topical cream</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Pyrimidine antagonist and cell-cycle specific. Blocks action of enzymes essential to normal DNA and RNA synthesis and may
         become incorporated in RNA to form a fraudulent molecule; unbalanced growth and death of cell follow. Exhibits higher affinity
         for tumor tissue than healthy tissue.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Highly toxic, especially to proliferative cells in neoplasms, bone marrow, and intestinal mucosa. Low therapeutic index with
         high potential for severe hematologic toxicity.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Systemically as single agent and in combination with other antineoplastics for palliative treatment of carefully selected
         patients with inoperable neoplasms of breast, colon or rectum, stomach, pancreas, urinary bladder, ovary, cervix, liver. Also
         topically for solar or actinic keratoses and superficial basal cell carcinoma.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>To induce repigmentation in vitiligo; actinic cheilitis; malignant effusions; mucosal leukoplakia.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Poor nutritional status; myelosuppression. Safety during pregnancy (category D) or lactation is not established.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Major surgery during previous month; history of highdose pelvic irradiation, metastatic cell infiltration of bone marrow,
         previous use of alkylating agents; men and women in childbearing ages; hepatic or renal impairment.

<li>Use gloved fingers to apply topical drug.</li>
<li>Do not use occlusive dressings with topical drug. Use a porous gauze dressing for cosmetic purposes; does not cause inflammation.</li>
<li>
            				Note: Second-degree burns resulting from contact between plastic eyeglass frames and treated skin have been reported. Reduce risk
            of burns or irritation by treating skin that contacts frames only at night when glasses are not worn, and using the lowest
            effective strength of topical preparation.

<li>Fluorouracil solution is normally colorless to faint yellow. Slight discoloration during storage does not appear to affect
            potency or safety. Discard dark yellow solution. If a precipitate forms, redissolve drug by heating to 60° C (140°
            F) and shake vigorously. Allow to cool to body temperature before administration.

<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Obtain total and differential leukocyte counts before each dose is administered. Discontinue drug if leukopenia
            occurs (WBC 3) or if patient develops thrombocytopenia (platelet count 3). Baseline and periodic checks of Hct and liver and kidney function are also advised.
         </li>
<li>Use protective isolation of patient during leukopenic period (WBC 3).
         </li>
<li>Watch for and report signs of abnormal bleeding from any source during thrombocytopenic period (day 717); inspect skin
            for ecchymotic and petechial areas. Protect patient from trauma.
         </li>
<li>Report disorientation or confusion; drug should be withdrawn immediately.</li>
<li>Establish a reference data base for body weight, I&amp;O ratio and pattern, food preferences and dietary habits, bowel habits,
            and condition of mouth.
         </li>
<li>Report intractable vomiting to physician.</li>
<li>Indications to discontinue drug: Severe stomatitis, leukopenia (WBC 3 or rapidly decreasing count), intractable vomiting, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia (platelets 3), and hemorrhage from any site.
         </li>
<li>Inspect patient's mouth daily. Promptly report cracked lips, xerostomia, white patches, and erythema of buccal membranes.</li>
<li>Report development of maculopapular rash; it usually responds to symptomatic treatment and is reversible.</li>
<li>Be aware of expected response of lesion to topical 5-FU: Erythema followed in sequence by vesiculation, erosion, ulceration,
            necrosis, epithelialization. Applications of drug are continued until ulcerative stage is reached (26 wk after initial
            applications) and then discontinued.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Systemic toxicity may follow use of topical drug on large ulcerated area. Report symptoms promptly.

<ul>
<li>Understand that it is very important to report the first signs of toxicity: Anorexia, vomiting, nausea, stomatitis, diarrhea,
            GI bleeding.
         </li>
<li>Schedule and make sure to complete periodic checks on liver and kidney function.</li>
<li>Do not change dosage regimen (i.e., do not increase or omit doses or change dosage intervals).</li>
<li>Avoid exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet lamp treatments. Protect exposed skin. Photosensitivity usually subsides 23
            mo after last dose.
         </li>
<li>Report promptly to physician any difficulty in maintaining balance while ambulating.</li>
<li>Be aware that your hair may fall out; new hair growth usually begins within 68 wk.</li>
<li>Use contraception during 5-FU treatment. If you suspect you are pregnant, tell your physician.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
