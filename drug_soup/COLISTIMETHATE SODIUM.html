<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>150 mg injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Polymyxin antibiotic and parenteral form of colistin. Similar to polymyxin B in structure and actions but about one-third
         to one-fifth as potent. Antibacterial activity and overall toxicity are less, but nephrotoxic potential is almost identical
         with that of polymyxin B. Believed to act by affecting phospholipid component in bacterial cytoplasmic membranes with resulting
         damage and leakage of essential intracellular components.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Bactericidal against most gram-negative organisms including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Haemophilus</i> sp, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Brucella, Salmonella, Shigella,</i>
<i>Bordetella, Pasteurella</i>, and <i>Vibrio</i>. Not effective against <i>Proteus</i> or <i>Neisseria</i> species. Complete cross-resistance and cross-sensitivity to polymyxin B reported but not to broad-spectrum antibiotics.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Particularly for severe, acute and chronic UTIs caused by susceptible strains of gram-negative organisms resistant to other
         antibiotics. Has been used with carbenicillin for <i>Pseudomonas</i> sepsis in children with acute leukopenia.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to polypeptide antibiotics; concomitant use of drugs that potentiate neuromuscular blocking effect (aminoglycoside
         antibiotics, other polymyxins, anticholinesterases, curariform muscle relaxants, ether, sodium citrate); nephrotoxic and ototoxic
         drugs; pregnancy (category B).
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Impaired renal function; myasthenia gravis; older adult patients, infants; lactation.</p>

<li>Reconstitute each 150-mg vial with 2 mL of sterile water for injection to yield a concentration of 75 mg/mL. Swirl vial gently
            during reconstitution to avoid bubble formation. IM injection should be made deep into upper outer quadrant of buttock. Patients
            commonly experience pain at injection site. Rotate sites.

<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Culture and susceptibility tests should be performed initially and periodically during therapy to determine responsiveness
            of causative organisms. Baseline renal function tests should be performed prior to therapy; frequent monitoring of renal function
            and urine drug levels is advisable during therapy. Impaired renal function increases the possibility of nephrotoxicity, apnea,
            and neuromuscular blockade.
         </li>
<li>Report restlessness or dyspnea promptly. Respiratory arrest has been reported after IM administration.</li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O ratio and patterns: Decrease in urine output or change in I&amp;O ratio and rising BUN, serum creatinine, and serum
            drug levels (without dosage increase) are indications of renal toxicity. If they occur, withhold drug and report to physician.
         </li>
<li>Close monitoring of older adult patients and infants is essential. They are particularly prone to renal toxicity because they
            tend to have inadequate renal reserves.
         </li>
<li>Be alert to neurologic symptoms: changes in speech and hearing, visual changes, drowsiness, dizziness, ataxia, and transient
            paresthesias, and keep physician informed.
         </li>
<li>Monitor closely postoperative patients who have received curariform muscle relaxants, ether, or sodium citrate for signs of
            neuromuscular blockade (delayed recovery, muscle weakness, depressed respiration).
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid operating a vehicle or other potentially hazardous activities while on drug therapy because of the possibility of transient
            neurologic disturbances.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed without consulting the physician.</li>
