<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Steroidal compound and specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone. Presumably acts by competing with aldosterone for
         cellular receptor sites in distal renal tubule. Promotes sodium and chloride excretion without concomitant loss of potassium.
         Diuretic effect reportedly not associated with hyperuricemia or hyperglycemia. Activity depends on presence of endogenous
         or exogenous aldosterone.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>A diuretic agent that promotes sodium and chloride excretion without concomitant loss of potassium. Lowers systolic and diastolic
         pressures in hypertensive patients.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Clinical conditions associated with augmented aldosterone production, as in essential hypertension, refractory edema due to
         CHF, hepatic cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and idiopathic edema. May be used to potentiate actions of other diuretics and
         antihypertensive agents or for its potassium-sparing effect. Also used for treatment of (and as presumptive test for) primary
         aldosteronism.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Hirsutism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome or idiopathic hirsutism; adjunct in treatment of myasthenia gravis and familial
         periodic paralysis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Anuria, acute renal insufficiency; progressing impairment of kidney function, hyperkalemia; pregnancy (category D), lactation.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>BUN of 40 mg/dL or greater, liver disease.</p>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Check blood pressure before initiation of therapy and at regular intervals throughout therapy.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Monitor serum electrolytes (sodium and potassium) especially during early therapy; monitor digoxin level when used
            concurrently.
         </li>
<li>Assess for signs of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and signs of digoxin toxicity.</li>
<li>Monitor daily I&amp;O and check for edema. Report lack of diuretic response or development of edema; both may indicate tolerance
            to drug.
         </li>
<li>Weigh patient under standard conditions before therapy begins and daily throughout therapy. Weight is a useful index of need
            for dosage adjustment. For patients with ascites, physician may want measurements of abdominal girth.
         </li>
<li>Observe for and report immediately the onset of mental changes, lethargy, or stupor in patients with liver disease.</li>
<li>Adverse reactions are generally reversible with discontinuation of drug. Gynecomastia appears to be related to dosage level
            and duration of therapy; it may persist in some after drug is stopped.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Be aware that the maximal diuretic effect may not occur until third day of therapy and that diuresis may continue for 23
            d after drug is withdrawn.
         </li>
<li>Report signs of hyponatremia or hyperkalemia (see Appendix F), most likely to occur in patients with severe cirrhosis.</li>
<li>Avoid replacing fluid losses with large amounts of free water (can result in dilutional hyponatremia).</li>
<li>Weigh 23 times each week. Report gains/loss of <img src="../images/special/greaterorequal.gif"/>5 lb.</li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in potentially hazardous activities until response to the drug is known.</li>
<li>Avoid excessive intake of high-potassium foods and salt substitutes.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
