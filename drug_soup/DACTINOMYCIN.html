<p>0.5 mg injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Potent cytotoxic antibiotic derived from mixture of actinomycins produced by <i>Streptomyces parvulus</i>. Toxic properties preclude its use as antibiotic. Complexes with DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis.
         Causes delayed myelosuppression. Potentiates effects of x-ray therapy; the converse also appears likely.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Drug has antineoplastic properties that result from inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>As single agent or in combination with other antineoplastics or radiation to treat Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, carcinoma
         of testes and uterus, Ewing's sarcoma, and sarcoma botryoides.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Malignant melanoma, trophoblastic tumors, Kaposi's sarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, among others.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Chickenpox, herpes zoster, and other viral infections; pregnancy (category C), lactation, infants 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Previous therapy with antineoplastics or radiation within 36 wk, bone marrow depression; infections; history of gout;
         impairment of kidney or liver function; obesity.

<ul>
<li>Observe injection site frequently; if extravasation occurs, stop infusion immediately. Restart infusion in another vein. Report
            to physician. Institute prompt local treatment to prevent thrombophlebitis and necrosis.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for severe toxic effects that occur with high frequency. Effects usually appear 24 d after a course of therapy
            is stopped and may reach maximal severity 12 wk following discontinuation of therapy.
         </li>
<li>Use antiemetic drugs to control nausea and vomiting, which often occur a few hours after drug administration. Vomiting may
            be severe enough to require intermittent therapy. Observe patient daily for signs of drug toxicity.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Frequent renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function tests are advised. Perform WBC counts daily, and platelet counts
            every 3 d to detect hematopoietic depression.
         </li>
<li>Monitor temperature and inspect oral membranes daily for stomatitis.</li>
<li>Monitor for stomatitis, diarrhea, and severe hematopoietic depression. These may require prompt interruption of therapy until
            drug toxicity subsides.
         </li>
<li>Report onset of unexplained bleeding, jaundice, and wheezing. Also, be alert to signs of agranulocytosis (see Appendix F).
            Report to physician. Antibiotic therapy, protective isolation, and discontinuation of the antineoplastic are indicated.
         </li>
<li>Observe and report symptoms of hyperuricemia (see Appendix F). Urge patient to increase fluid intake up to 3000 mL/d if allowed.</li>
