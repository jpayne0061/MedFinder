<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>250 mg, 500 mg tablets; 375 mg, 500 mg sustained-release tablets; 125 mg/5 mL, 187 mg/5 mL, 250 mg/5 mL, 375 mg/5 mL suspension</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Semisynthetic, second-generation oral cephalosporin antibiotic similar to cefonicid. Possibly more active than other oral
         cephalosporins against gram-negative bacilli, especially beta-lactamase-producing <i>Haemophilus influenzae,</i> including ampicillin-resistant strains. Also active against <i>Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella sp</i> and certain gram-positive strains, e.g., <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes,</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Preferentially binds to one or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on cell walls of susceptible organisms.
         This inhibits third and final stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis, thus killing the bacterium.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Effective in treating acute otitis media and acute sinusitis where the causative agent is resistant to other antibiotics.
         Useful in treating gonorrhea, respiratory and urinary tract infections. Partial cross-allergenicity between penicillins and
         cephalosporins has been reported.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Treatment of otitis media and infections of upper and lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, and skin and skin structures
         caused by ampicillin-resistant <i>H. influenzae;</i> acute uncomplicated UTI.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins and related antibiotics; pregnancy (category B), lactation. Safe use in infants 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>History of sensitivity to penicillins or other drug allergies; markedly impaired renal function.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give sustained-release tablets with food to enhance absorption. Food does not affect absorption of capsules.</li>
<li>Ensure that sustained-release tablets are not chewed or crushed. They must be swallowed whole.</li>
<li>After stock oral suspension is prepared, it should be kept refrigerated. Expiration date should appear on label. Discard unused
            portion after 14 d. Shake well before pouring.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Determine previous hypersensitivity to cephalosporins, penicillins, and other drug allergies before therapy is initiated.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Perform culture and sensitivity tests prior to and periodically during therapy.</li>
<li>Diarrhea, the most frequent adverse effect, may be due to a pharmacologic effect or to associated change in intestinal flora.
            If it persists, interruption of therapy may be necessary.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for manifestations of drug hypersensitivity (see Appendix F). Discontinue drug and promptly report them if they appear.</li>
<li>Monitor for manifestations of superinfection (see Appendix F). Promptly report their appearance.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report promptly any signs or symptoms of superinfection (see Appendix F).</li>
<li>Yogurt or buttermilk (if allowed) may serve as a prophylactic against intestinal superinfections by helping to maintain normal
            intestinal flora.
         </li>
<li>Take your medication for the full course of therapy as directed by physician.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
