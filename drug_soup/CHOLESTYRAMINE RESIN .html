<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>4 g powder for suspension; 1 g tablet</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Anion-exchange resin used for its cholesterol-lowering effect. Adsorbs and combines with intestinal bile acids in exchange
         for chloride ions to form an insoluble, nonabsorbable complex that is excreted in the feces. As a result, bile salts are continually
         (but not entirely) prevented from reentry into the enterohepatic circulation, thus, increasing fecal loss of bile acids. This
         leads to lowered serum total cholesterol by decreasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>The resin anion-exchange agent increases fecal loss of bile acids which leads to lowered serum total cholesterol by decreasing
         (LDL) cholesterol, and reducing bile acid deposit in dermal tissues (decreasing pruritus). Serum triglyceride levels may increase
         or remain unchanged.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>As adjunct to diet therapy in management of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (type IIa hyperlipidemia) with a significant
         risk of atherosclerotic heart disease and MI; for relief of pruritus secondary to partial biliary stasis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>To control diarrhea caused by excess bile acids in colon; for hyperoxaluria.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Complete biliary obstruction, hypersensitivity to bile acid sequestrants; pregnancy (category C), lactation. Safe use in children
         <img src="../images/special/lesserorequal.gif"/>6 y not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Bleeding disorders; hemorrhoids; impaired GI function, peptic ulcer, malabsorption states (e.g., steatorrhea); phenylketonuria
         (Questran Light only).

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Place contents of one packet or one level scoopful on surface of at least 120 to 180 mL (46 oz) of water or other preferred
            liquid. Permit drug to hydrate by standing without stirring 12 min, twirling glass occasionally, then stir until suspension
            is uniform. Rinse glass with small amount of liquid and have patient drink remainder to ensure entire dose is taken. Administer
            before meals.
         </li>
<li>Always dissolve cholestyramine powder before administration; it is irritating to mucous membranes and may cause esophageal
            impaction if administered dry.
         </li>
<li>Store in tightly closed container at 15°30° C (59°86° F) unless otherwise specified.</li>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor therapeutic effect. Serum cholesterol levels are reduced within 2448 h after treatment starts and may continue
            to decline for a year. After withdrawal of cholestyramine, cholesterol levels usually return to baseline level in about 2
            to 4 wk.
         </li>
<li>Be alert to early symptoms of hypoprothrombinemia (petechiae, ecchymoses, abnormal bleeding from mucous membranes, tarry stools)
            and report their occurrence promptly. Long-term use of cholestyramine resin can increase bleeding tendency.
         </li>
<li>Preexisting constipation may be worsened in the older adult, women, and in those taking &gt;24 g/d.</li>
<li>Consult physician regarding supplemental vitamins A and D and folic acid that may be required by patient on long-term therapy.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Periodic CBC, platelet count, serum electrolytes, and lipid profile.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report constipation immediately to physician. High-bulk diet with adequate fluid intake is an essential adjunct to cholestyramine
            treatment and generally resolves the problems of constipation and bloating sensation.
         </li>
<li>Do not omit doses. Sudden withdrawal can promote uninhibited absorption of other drugs taken concomitantly, leading to toxicity
            or overdosage.
         </li>
<li>GI adverse effects usually subside after the first month of drug therapy.</li>
<li>The following symptoms may be drug-induced and should be reported promptly: severe gastric distress with nausea and vomiting,
            unusual weight loss, black stools, severe hemorrhoids (GI bleeding), sudden back pain.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while using this drug.</li>
