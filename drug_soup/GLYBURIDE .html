<p>1.25 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg tablets; 1.5 mg, 3 mg, 4.5 mg, 6 mg micronized tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>One of the most potent of the sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents. Second-generation sulfonylurea closely related to tolbutamide.
         Potency is enhanced by as much as 200-fold over first-generation agents.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Appears to lower blood sugar concentration in both diabetic and nondiabetic individuals by sensitizing functioning pancreatic
         beta cells to release insulin in the presence of elevated serum glucose levels. Blood glucose-lowering effect persists during
         long-term glyburide treatment, but there is a gradual decline in meal stimulated secretion of endogenous insulin toward pretreatment
         levels.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjunct to diet to lower blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus; after dietary control alone has failed.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to glyburide, diabetic ketoacidosis, as sole therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus; pregnancy (category C);
         withhold 14 d before labor and delivery; lactation. Safe use in children is not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Limit use in patients with cardiovascular disease; renal or hepatic insufficiency; older adults, debilitated, or malnourished
         patients; adrenal or pituitary insufficiency.

<ul>
<li>Monitor blood glucose levels carefully during the dangerous early treatment period when dosage is being individualized. Older
            adults are especially vulnerable to glyburide-induced hypoglycemia (see Appendix F) because the antidiabetic agent is long-acting.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: The first signs of hypoglycemia may be hard to detect when the patient is also receiving a beta blocker or is an older adult.
            						
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Monitor at regular intervals: Blood and urine glucose, HbA1c, urine ketones, and liver function tests.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Eat or drink some form of sugar (e.g., corn syrup, orange juice with 2 or 3 tsp of table sugar) when symptoms of hypoglycemia
            occur. Report reaction to physician promptly.
         </li>
<li>Remember that loss of control of diabetes may result from stress such as fever, surgery, trauma, or infection. Check blood
            glucose and urine for ketones more frequently during stress periods; transfer from the sulfonylurea to insulin may be necessary.
         </li>
<li>Keep all follow-up medical appointments and adhere to dietary instructions, regular exercise program, and scheduled urine
            and blood testing.
         </li>
<li>Report blurred vision to physician.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
