<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>1 g tablets; 5 g powder for suspension</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Insoluble chloride salt of a basic anion exchange resin with high molecular weight, which adsorbs and combines with intestinal
         bile acids in exchange for chloride ions to form an insoluble, nonabsorbable complex that is excreted in the feces.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Binds with bile acids in intestinal tract to form an insoluble complex that is excreted in the feces, thus reducing circulating
         cholesterol and increasing serum LDL removal rate. Serum triglycerides are not affected or are minimally increased.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Pruritus associated with partial biliary obstruction; also as adjunct to diet therapy of patient with primary hypercholesterolemia
         (type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia) or with coronary artery disease unresponsive to diet or other measures alone.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Digitoxin overdose and hyperoxaluria and to control postoperative diarrhea caused by excess bile acids in colon.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Complete biliary obstruction, hypersensitivity to bile acid sequestrants; pregnancy (category C), lactation. Safe use in children
         not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Hemorrhoids; bleeding disorders; malabsorption states; the older adult.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give 30 min before a meal when ordered a.c.</li>
<li>Ensure that tablets are not chewed or crushed. They must be swallowed whole.</li>
<li>Always mix granule form with liquids, juices, soups, cereals, or pulpy fruits. Add powder to at least 90 mL fluid. When carbonated
            drink is used, slowly stir in a large glass because excess foaming may occur. Rinse glass with small amount extra fluid to
            be sure all the drug is taken.
         </li>
<li>Drugs given concomitantly should be scheduled at least 1 h before or 4 h after ingestion of colestipol to reduce interference
            with their absorption (see drug interactions).
         </li>
<li>Store at 15°30° C (59°86° F) in tightly closed container unless otherwise instructed.</li>

<ul>
<li>Watch for changes in bowel elimination pattern. Constipation should not be allowed to persist without medical attention.</li>
<li>Lab test: Monitor serum sodium and potassium levels. Monitor for and report S&amp;S of hyponatremia and hypokalemia (see Appendix
            F).
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not change the times for taking each drug, nor omit or increase doses. Any change in established regimens should be approved
            by the physician. It is important to keep to established regimens for colestipol and other drugs.
         </li>
<li>If receiving prolonged therapy, report unusual bleeding (vitamin K deficiency). Colestipol prevents absorption of <small>FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS</small> (A, D, E, K).
         </li>
<li>Do not use OTC drugs unless physician has given approval.</li>
<li>Check with physician regarding permitted amount of alcohol intake.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
