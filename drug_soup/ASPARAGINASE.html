<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>10,000 IU vial</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>A highly toxic drug with a low therapeutic index. Catalyzes hydrolysis of asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia, thus depleting
         extracellular supply of an amino acid essential to synthesis of DNA and other nucleoproteins.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Reduced availability of asparagine causes death of tumor cells, since unlike normal cells, tumor cells are unable to synthesize
         their own supply. Resistance to cytotoxic action develops rapidly; therefore this is not an effective treatment for solid
         tumors and not recommended for maintenance therapy.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Primarily in combination regimens with other antineoplastic agents to treat acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Other leukemias, lymphosarcoma, and (intraarterially) treatment of hypoglycemia due to pancreatic islet cell tumor.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>History of/or existing pancreatitis; chickenpox (existing or recent illness or exposure), herpetic infection. Safety during
         pregnancy (category C) or lactation is not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Liver impairment; diabetes mellitus; infections; history of urate calculi or gout; antineoplastic or radiation therapy.</p>

<td><span class="ivtitle">Intravenous</span><ul>
<li>An intradermal skin test is usually performed prior to initial dose and when drug is readministered after an interval of a
                     week or more; allergic reactions are unpredictable.
                  </li>
<li>Observe test site for at least 1 h for evidence of positive reaction (wheal, erythema). A negative skin test, however, does
                     not preclude possibility of an allergic reaction.
                  </li>
<li>Administer test dose and IV infusion under constant supervision by clinician experienced in cancer chemotherapy.</li>
<li>Use only clear solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="routemethod">PREPARE:</span> <span class="methodtype"> Intermittent:</span>   Reconstitute with sterile water or with 0.9% NaCl. Each 10,000 IU vial is diluted with 5 mL of diluent to yield 2000 IU/mL. Shake vial well to promote dissolution of powder. Avoid vigorous shaking. Ordinary shaking does not inactivate the enzyme
                  or cause foaming of content.

                  one of these solutions. Give over a period of not less than 30 min. Use a 5-mm filter to remove gelatinous fiber-like particles that can develop in solutions on standing.

<ul>
<li>Have immediately available: Personnel, drugs, and equipment for treating allergic reaction (which may range from urticaria
            to anaphylactic shock) whenever drug is administered, including skin testing.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for S&amp;S and be alert to evidence of hypersensitivity or anaphylactoid reaction (see Appendix F) during drug administration.
            Anaphylaxis usually occurs within 3060 min after dose has been given and is more likely with intermittent administrations,
            particularly at intervals of <img src="../images/special/greaterorequal.gif"/>7 d.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O and maintain adequate fluid intake.</li>
<li>Evaluate CNS function (general behavior, emotional status, level of consciousness, thought content, motor function) before
            and during therapy.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Toxicity potential is increased when giving drug immediately before a course of prednisone and vincristine; toxicity appears
            less when given after these drugs.
            						
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Periodic serum amylase, serum calcium blood glucose, coagulation factors, ammonia and uric acid levels, hepatic
            and renal function tests, peripheral blood counts, and bone marrow function; liver function tests at least twice weekly during
            therapy.
         </li>
<li>Monitor diabetics for loss of glycemic control.</li>
<li>Monitor for and report S&amp;S of hyperammonemia: anorexia, vomiting, lethargy, weak pulse, depressed temperature, irritability,
            asterixis, seizures, coma.
         </li>
<li>Anticipate possible prolonged or exaggerated effects of concurrently given drugs or their toxicity because of potential serious
            hepatic dysfunction that reduces enzymatic detoxification of other drugs. Report incidence promptly.
         </li>
<li>Watch for neurotoxic reaction (25% of patients) which usually appears within the first few days of therapy. It is manifested
            by tiredness and changing levels of consciousness (ranging from confusion to coma).
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Protect from infection during first several days of treatment when circulating lymphoblasts decrease markedly and leukocyte
            counts may fall below normal. Report promptly S&amp;S of infection: chill, fever, aches, sore throat.
            						
         </li>
<li>Report sudden severe abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, particularly if these symptoms occur after medication is discontinued
            (may indicate pancreatitis).

<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>

            							Note: Therapeutic response will most likely be accompanied by some toxicity in all patients; toxicity is reportedly greater in adults
            than in children.
            						
         </li>
<li>Notify physician of continued loss of weight or onset of foot and ankle swelling.</li>
<li>Notify physician without delay if nausea or vomiting makes it difficult to take all prescribed medication.</li>
<li>Report onset of unusual bleeding, bruising, petechiae, melena, skin rash or itching, yellowed skin and sclera, joint pain,
            puffy face, or dyspnea.
         </li>
<li>Do not drive or operate equipment that requires alertness and skill. Exercise caution with potentially hazardous activities.
            These effects can continue several weeks after last dose of the drug.
