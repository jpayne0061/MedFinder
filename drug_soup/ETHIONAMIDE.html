<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Any form of active tuberculosis when treatment with primary antituberculosis drugs (e.g., isoniazid, streptomycin, ethambutol,

<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>

<li>Give with or after meals to minimize GI adverse effects. Some patients tolerate ethionamide best when it is taken as a single
            dose after the evening meal or as a single dose at bedtime. GI symptoms appear to increase with divided doses, although serum
            concentrations may be higher.
         </li>
<li>About 50% of patients cannot tolerate a single dose larger than 500 mg because of GI adverse effects. An antiemetic may
            be prescribed, but if symptoms persist, drug should be discontinued.
         </li>
<li>Physician may prescribe pyridoxine (vitamin B<sub>6</sub>) concurrently to prevent or relieve peripheral neuritis and other neurotoxic effects.
         </li>
<li>Store in a cool, dry place at 8°15° C (46°59° F) in a tightly closed container unless otherwise
            directed.
         </li>

<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Perform C&amp;S prior to start of therapy. Baseline liver function tests (AST and ALT), CBC, and kidney function tests
            including urinalysis and every 24 wk during therapy.
         </li>
<li>Report onset of skin rash. Progression to exfoliative dermatitis can occur if drug is not promptly discontinued.</li>
<li>Monitor blood glucose &amp; HbA1c closely in the diabetic until response to drug is established. These patients appear to be especially
            prone to hepatotoxicity (see Appendix F).
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid alcohol or use in moderation because ethionamide may increase potential for liver dysfunction.</li>
<li>Notify physician of S&amp;S of hepatotoxicity (see Appendix F); generally reversible if drug is promptly withdrawn.</li>
<li>Make position changes slowly and in stages, particularly from lying to upright posture if experiencing hypotension.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
