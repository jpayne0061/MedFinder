<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>50 mg, 100 mg capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Structurally related to folic acid. Like spironolactone has weak diuretic action and a potassium-sparing effect. Promotes
         excretion of sodium, chloride (to lesser extent), and carbonate. Unlike spironolactone, blocks potassium excretion by direct
         action on distal renal tubule rather than by inhibiting aldosterone. Decreased glomerular filtration rate and elevated BUN
         are associated with daily administration.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Weak diuretic action and a potassium-sparing effect.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjunct in the management of edema associated with CHF, hepatic cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, idiopathic edema, steroid-induced
         edema, and edema due to secondary hyperaldosteronism. Also alone or in conjunction with a thiazide or loop diuretic in patients
         with hypertension because of its potassium-sparing activity.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to drug; anuria, severe or progressive kidney disease or dysfunction; severe liver disease; elevated serum
         potassium. Safety during pregnancy (category B) or lactation is not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Impaired kidney or liver function; history of gouty arthritis; diabetes mellitus, history of kidney stones.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Empty capsule and give with fluid or mix with food, if patient cannot swallow capsule.</li>
<li>Give drug with or after meals to prevent or minimize nausea.</li>
<li>Schedule doses to prevent interruption of sleep from diuresis (e.g., with or after breakfast if a single dose is taken, or
            no later than 6 p.m. if more than one dose is prescribed). Consult physician.
         </li>
<li>Withdraw drug gradually in patients on prolonged or high-dose therapy in order to prevent rebound increased urinary excretion
            of potassium.
         </li>
<li>Store in tight, light-resistant containers at 15°30° C (59°86° F) unless otherwise directed.</li>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor BP during periods of dosage adjustment. Hypotensive reactions, although rare, have been reported. Take care with ambulation,
            particularly for older adults.
         </li>
<li>Weigh patient under standard conditions, prior to drug initiation and daily during therapy.</li>
<li>Diuretic response usually occurs on first day of therapy; maximum effect may not occur for several days.</li>
<li>Monitor and report oliguria and unusual changes in I&amp;O ratio. Consult physician regarding allowable fluid intake.</li>
<li>Be alert for S&amp;S of kidney stone formation; reported in patients taking high doses or who have low urine volume and increased
            urine acidity.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Obtain baseline and periodic determinations of serum potassium and other electrolytes. Obtain periodic kidney function
            (BUN, serum creatinine) in patients with known or suspected renal insufficiency. Obtain periodic blood studies in patients
            on prolonged therapy or with cirrhosis since both are prone to develop megaloblastic anemia.
         </li>
<li>Observe for S&amp;S of hyperkalemia (see Appendix F), particularly in patients with renal insufficiency, on high-dose or prolonged
            therapy, older adults, and those with diabetes.
         </li>
<li>Do not give to a diabetic patient unless blood glucose is controlled because triamterene may increase blood glucose. Monitor
            patients closely.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not take potassium supplements, potassium-rich diet, and salt substitutes; unlike most diuretics, triamterene promotes
            potassium retention.
         </li>
<li>Do not restrict salt; there is a possibility of low-salt syndrome (hyponatremia). Consult physician.</li>
<li>Report overpowering fatigue or weakness, malaise, fever, sore throat, or mouth (possible symptoms of granulocytopenia) and
            unusual bleeding or bruising (thrombocytopenia) to physician.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that drug may cause photosensitivity; avoid exposure to sun and sunlamps.</li>
<li>Drug may impart a harmless pale blue fluorescence to urine.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
