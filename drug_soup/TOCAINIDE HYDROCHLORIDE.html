<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>400 mg, 600 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Antiarrhythmic agent (class IB) and analog of lidocaine, with similar electrophysiologic characteristics and hemodynamic properties.
         Effective orally. Suppresses PVCs and may have particular use in arrhythmias associated with a prolonged QT interval that
         do not respond to quinidine-like antiarrhythmics (Class IA). Decreases action potential duration in Purkinje fibers and slightly
         decreases resting membrane potential. QRS and QT intervals do not change.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Antiarrhythmic action results from shortening the effective refractory periods of atria, AV node, and ventricles without affecting
         AV conduction.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Refractory ventricular arrhythmia. To increase effectiveness, it may be combined with a class IA antiarrhythmic (e.g., quinidine,
         disopyramide) or with propranolol. Also used to prevent ventricular tachyarrhythmia after acute MI.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to tocainide and to local anesthetics of the amide type; second- or third-degree AV block (in absence of
         artificial ventricular pacemaker); hypokalemia; myasthenia gravis; pregnancy (category C), lactation. Safety in children is
         not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Multiple drug therapy; known heart failure patient with minimum cardiac reserve; kidney or liver disease.</p>

<ul>
<li>Effective serum concentration is 3.510 mcg/mL.</li>
<li>Monitor plasma level when steady-state drug level is attained, especially if patient has kidney or liver dysfunction.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Baseline serum potassium, liver and kidney functions. Monitor blood counts during first 6 mo of treatment; abnormal
            counts usually stabilize within 1 mo after withdrawal of treatment.
         </li>
<li>Correct preexisting hypokalemia prior to initiating drug therapy.</li>
<li>Be aware that onset of tremors is good clinical indicator that maximum dose is being approached.</li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O ratio and pattern. Report symptoms of kidney dysfunction. Drug elimination is significantly decreased in patient
            with kidney or liver dysfunction.
         </li>
<li>Anticipate and report evidence of blood dyscrasia (see Appendix F).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Understand significance of irregular pulse and when and how to check it.</li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in potentially hazardous activities until response to drug is known.</li>
<li>Report symptomatic bradycardia to physician. Dose adjustment or withdrawal will follow.</li>
<li>Report chest pain, exertional dyspnea, wheezing, and cough even if no fever is present promptly to physician. Pulmonary fibrosis
            is a serious adverse effect and should be ruled out. Drug is discontinued if pulmonary symptoms persist or if pulmonary disorder
            is diagnosed.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
