<p>15 g/60 mL suspension; 100 mg/g powder</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Sulfonic cation-exchange resin that removes potassium from body by exchanging sodium ion for potassium, particularly in large
         intestine; potassium-containing resin is then excreted. Small amounts of other cations such as calcium and magnesium may be
         lost during treatment.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Removes potassium from body by exchanging sodium ion for potassium through the large intestine.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Hyperkalemia.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Patients with hypokalemia; hypersensitivity to Kayexalate.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Older adults; acute or chronic kidney failure; patients receiving digitalis preparations; patients who cannot tolerate even
         a small increase in sodium load (e.g., CHF, severe hypertension, and marked edema); pregnancy (category C), lactation.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give as a suspension in a small quantity of water or in syrup. Usual amount of fluid ranges from 20100 mL or approximately
            34 mL/g of drug.
         </li>
</ul><span class="adminroutetype">Rectal</span><br/><ul>
<li>Use warm fluid (as prescribed) to prepare the emulsion for enema.</li>
<li>Administer at body temperature and introduce by gravity, keeping suspension particles in solution by stirring. Flush suspension
            with 50100 mL of fluid; then clamp tube and leave it in place.
         </li>
<li>Urge patient to retain enema at least 3060 min but as long as several hours if possible.</li>
<li>Irrigate colon (after enema solution has been expelled) with 1 or 2 quarts flushing solution (non-sodium containing). Drain
            returns constantly through a Y-tube connection.
         </li>
<li>Store remainder of prepared solution for 24 h; then discard.</li>

<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Determine serum potassium levels daily throughout therapy. Monitor acidbase balance, electrolytes, and minerals
            in patients receiving repeated doses.
         </li>
<li>Serum potassium levels do not always reflect intracellular potassium deficiency. Observe patient closely for early clinical
            signs of severe hypokalemia (see Appendix F). ECGs are also recommended.
         </li>
<li>Consult physician about restricting sodium content from dietary and other sources since drug contains approximately 100 mg
            (4.1 mEq) of sodium per gram (1 tsp, 15 mEq sodium).
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Check bowel function daily. Usually, a mild laxative is prescribed to prevent constipation (common adverse effect). Older
            adult patients are particularly prone to fecal impaction.
         </li>
