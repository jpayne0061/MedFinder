<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Baseline and periodic determinations of serum uric acid and creatinine are advised, as well as CBC, including Hgb,
            platelet count, serum electrolytes, and urinalysis.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for dose-related adverse effects; they are most likely to occur during the initial course of treatment.</li>
<li>Monitor for early signs of colchicine toxicity including weakness, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea,
            regardless of administration route. Report to physician. To avoid more serious toxicity, drug should be discontinued promptly
            until symptoms subside.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O ratio and pattern (during acute gouty attack): High fluid intake promotes excretion and reduces danger of crystal
            formation in kidneys and ureters.
         </li>
<li>Keep physician informed of patient's progress. Drug should be stopped when pain of acute gout is relieved. Therapeutic response:
            articular pain and swelling generally subside within 812 h and usually disappear in 2472 h after PO therapy, and
            612 h after IV administration.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>If taking colchicine at home, withhold drug and report to the physician the onset of GI symptoms or signs of bone marrow depression
            (nausea, sore throat, bleeding gums, sore mouth, fever, fatigue, malaise, unusual bleeding or bruising).
         </li>
<li>Keep colchicine on hand at all times to start therapy or increase dosage, as prescribed by physician, at the first suggestion
            of an acute attack.
         </li>
<li>Physician may prescribe sodium bicarbonate, or sodium or potassium citrate, to maintain alkaline urine and thus prevent formation
            of urate stones.
         </li>
<li>Avoid fermented beverages such as beer, ale, and wine as they may precipitate gouty attack. The physician may allow distilled
            alcoholic beverages in moderation.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed without consulting physician.</li>
