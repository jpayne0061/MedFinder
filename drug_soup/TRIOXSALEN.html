<p>5 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Systemic psoralen derivative structurally and pharmacologically related to methoxsalen but produces less intense melanogenic
         and erythremic responses. Produces resistance to solar damage in persons particularly susceptible to painful reactions with
         exposure to sunlight.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Accelerates pigmentation only when followed by exposure of skin to sunlight or ultraviolet irradiation, and may reach equivalence
         of a full summer of sun exposure.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>In conjunction with controlled exposure to ultraviolet light or sunlight to repigment vitiliginous skin, to improve tolerance
         to sunlight in patients with albinism, and to enhance pigmentation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Idiosyncratic reactions to psoralen compounds; melanoma or history of melanoma; invasive squamous cell carcinomas; aphakia
         (increased risk of retinal damage because of the absence of lenses); history of light sensitive diseases (porphyria, lupus,
         xeroderma pigmentosum, albinism); concomitant use with any preparation having internal or external photosensitizing capacity;
         cardiac disease. Safety during pregnancy (category C), lactation, or in children is not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Basal cell carcinoma; hepatic insufficiency.</p>

<li>Give with milk or after a meal to reduce gastric distress.</li>
<li> 				Note: If trioxsalen is used to increase tolerance of skin to sunlight, treatment is usually continued no longer than 14 d, with
            dosage not exceeding 140 mg. 			
         </li>
<li>Store in tightly closed, light-resistant container at 15°30° C (59°86° F).</li>

<ul>
<li>Expect that repigmentation of idiopathic vitiligo may begin a few weeks after start of treatment, but significant effects
            require 69 mo of therapy.
         </li>
<li> 							Note: Drug is discontinued if repigmentation is not apparent after 3 mo of treatment. 						</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain pigmentation by periodic exposure to sunlight.</li>
<li>Avoid the following: Figs, limes, parsley, parsnips, mustard, carrots, celery. Concomitant ingestion of furocoumarin-containing
            foods may intensify adverse reactions.
         </li>
<li>Adhere to dosage and exposure time prescribed by physician. Severe burning may occur with overdosage.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
