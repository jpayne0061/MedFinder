<p>5 mg tablets, capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Mechanism of action is not fully understood. Increase in dopaminergic activity is thought to be primarily due to selective
         inhibition of MAO type B activity. Although MAOs are widely distributed throughout the body, most of the MAO in the brain
         is type B.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Control of parkinsonism due to increased dopaminergic activity by interfering with dopamine reuptake at the synapse of neurons
         as well as its inhibition of MAO type B dopaminergic activity in the brain.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjunctive therapy of Parkinson's disease for patients being treated with levodopa and carbidopa who exhibit deterioration
         in the quality of their response to therapy.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to selegiline; concomitant use with meperidine and other opioids; lactation.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Hypertension and pregnancy (category C). Safety and efficacy in children are not established.</p>
