<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>100 mg powder for injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>IgG<sub>1</sub>-K monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a cytokine. Thus, it prevents TNF-alpha
         from binding to its receptors. TNF-alpha induces proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Treatment with infliximab reduces infiltration of inflammatory cells and TNF-alpha production in inflamed areas of the intestine.
         Elevated concentrations of TNF-alpha have been found in the stools of Crohn's disease patients and correlated with disease
         activity.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, including fistulizing Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to infliximab; CHF; infection, sepsis; murine protein hypersensitivity; lactation.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>History of allergic phenomena or untoward responses to monoclonal antibody preparation; renal or hepatic impairment; multiple
         sclerosis (potential exacerbation); fungal infection; heart failure, human antichimeric antibody (HACA); leukopenia, thrombocytopenia;
         immunosuppressed patients; neoplastic disease; tuberculosis; vaccination; vasculitis; neurological disease; neutropenia; seizure
         disorder, seizures; older adults; pregnancy (category B). Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients are not established.
