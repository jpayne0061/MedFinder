<p>0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg tablets; 0.125 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg drops; 0.2 mg/mL solution; 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.09%, 2% rinse; 0.5%, 1.2% gel</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Source of the fluorine ion, a trace element. Incorporates into developing tooth enamel, hardens surfaces, and increases resistance
         to cariogenic microbial processes. Topical application reduces acid production by bacteria in dental plaque and promotes remineralization
         of acid-damaged enamel. Application to exposed root surfaces supports formation of insoluble materials within dentinal tubules,
         thereby blocking transport of offending stimuli. Arrests rapid dental decay associated with drug-, radiation-, or age-related
         xerostomia. One of the few agents known that stimulates osteoblastic activity, leading to increased bone mass.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Topical application reduces acid production by bacteria in dental plaque and promotes remineralization of enamel.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>When fluoride ion concentration in drinking water is 0.7 ppm or less, to prevent periodontal disease and dental caries, to
         treat dental cervical hypersensitivity, and to control dental caries associated with xerostomia.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjunctive treatment of osteoporosis; management of bone lesions in multiple myeloma; to reduce bone pain in patient with
         metastatic prostatic carcinoma; to stabilize progression of hearing loss in a limited number of patients with otosclerosis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>When daily intake of fluoride from drinking water exceeds 0.7 ppm; low-sodium or sodium-free diets; hypersensitivity to fluoride;
         gels or dental rinses by children

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Avoid giving sodium fluoride with milk or dairy products. Calcium from these products combines with fluorine, decreasing its
            absorption.
         </li>
<li>Give drops preferably after meals. Give undiluted or mixed with fluids or foods.</li>
<li>Dissolve tablets in the mouth or chew before swallowing. Administer at bedtime (after brushing the teeth).</li>
</ul><span class="adminroutetype">Topical</span><br/><ul>
<li>Apply all fluorine preparations after thoroughly brushing and flossing; preferably at bedtime.</li>
<li>Do not swallow topical or rinse preparations.</li>
<li>If patient's mouth is sore, the neutral preparation (Thera-Flur N) is better tolerated.</li>
<li>Use as treatment for dental cervical hypersensitivity: thoroughly brush teeth; then swish PO solution around and between teeth
            for 1 min; expectorate. If gel is used, apply a few drops to toothbrush and brush gently onto affected surfaces.
         </li>
<li>Apply Gel-drops with applicators supplied by the dentist. Spread gel on inner surfaces of applicators, which are placed over
            lower and upper teeth at the same time. User bites down lightly for 6 min, then removes applicators and rinses mouth thoroughly.
            Applicators are cleaned with cold water.
         </li>
<li>Store all forms in tight plastic or paraffin-lined glass containers (sodium fluoride reacts with ordinary glass at a slow
            but appreciable rate) at 15°30° C (59°86° F). Avoid freezing.
         </li>

<ul>
<li>Monitor therapeutic effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not eat, drink, or rinse mouth for at least 30 min after using the rinsing solution.</li>
<li>Do not exceed recommended dosage. If mottling of teeth occurs, notify dentist.</li>
<li>Apply sodium fluoride gel or solution used in orthodontic treatment regimen immediately before attachment or reattachment
            of the tooth-encircling bands.
         </li>
<li>To be effective, fluorine supplementation must be consistent and continuous from infancy until 1214 y.</li>
<li>Consult dentist about continuing fluoride therapy if you move or there is a change in water supply (mottling may occur if
            drinking water has fluorine content &gt;1.5 ppm).
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking or using this drug without consulting physician.</li>
