<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Semisynthetic derivative of an opium alkaloid with actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine. Most prominent actions
         involve CNS and organs composed of smooth muscle. Binds with stereo-specific receptors in various sites of CNS to alter both
         perception of pain and emotional response to pain, but precise mechanism of action not clear. As potent as morphine and 1012
         times more potent than codeine.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Active against moderate to moderately severe pain. Appears to be more effective in relief of acute than long-standing pain.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Relief of moderate to moderately severe pain such as may occur with bursitis, dislocations, simple fractures and other injuries,
         and neuralgia. Relieves postoperative, postextractional, postpartum pain.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to oxycodone and principal drugs with which it is combined; during pregnancy (category B); for prolonged
         use or high doses at term (category D); lactation, and children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor patient's response closely, especially to sustained-release preparations.</li>
<li>Consult physician if nausea continues after first few days of therapy.</li>
<li> 							Note: Light-headedness, dizziness, sedation, or fainting appear to be more prominent in ambulatory than in nonambulatory patients
            and may be alleviated if patient lies down. 						
         </li>
<li>Evaluate patient's continued need for oxycodone preparations. Psychic and physical dependence and tolerance may develop with
            repeated use. The potential for drug abuse is high.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Check hepatic function and hematologic status periodically in patients on high dosage.</li>
<li>Be aware that serious overdosage of any oxycodone preparation presents problems associated with a narcotic overdose (respiratory
            depression, circulatory collapse, extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma).
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not alter dosage regimen by increasing, decreasing, or shortening intervals between doses. Habit formation and liver damage
            may result.
         </li>
<li>Avoid potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery while using oxycodone preparation.</li>
<li>Do not drink large amounts of alcoholic beverages while using oxycodone preparations; risk of liver damage is increased.</li>
<li>Check with physician before taking OTC drugs for colds, stomach distress, allergies, insomnia, or pain.</li>
<li>Inform surgeon or dentist that you are taking an oxycodone preparation before any surgical procedure is undertaken.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
