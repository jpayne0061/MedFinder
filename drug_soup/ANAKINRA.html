<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Anakinra is a recombinant human interleukin-1 type-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1R1). It blocks the biologic activity of IL-1
         by inhibiting IL-1 from binding to the interleukin receptors that are present in both bone and cartilage as well as other
         kinds of tissues.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Interleukin-1 is produced in response to inflammation. It mediates various responses of tissues including inflammatory and
         immunologic responses. Anakinra competes with interleukin-1 (IL-1) by inhibiting it from binding to its receptors in tissues.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in patients that have failed other disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Usually
         given in combination with another DMARD.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to anakinra; <i>E. coli</i> derived products; active infections; live vaccines.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Pregnancy (category B), lactation; neutropenia, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with frequent, serious infections;
         concomitant use of tumor necrosis factor blocking agents (TNF), etanercept, or infliximab.

<ul>
<li>Monitor for S&amp;S of infection (e.g., pneumonia or other URI, cellulitis). Withhold drug and notify physician if these appear.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Monitor absolute neutrophil count (ANC) prior to initiating anakinra, monthly for 3 mo, and q3mo thereafter for
            1 y; monitor periodically WBC and platelet counts.
         </li>
<li>Monitor closely patients with impaired renal function for S&amp;S of adverse drug reactions.</li>
<li>Assess for injection site reactions manifested by erythema, ecchymosis, inflammation, and pain.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Review carefully the "Information for Patients and Caregivers" leaflet for detailed instructions on handling and injecting
            anakinra.
         </li>
<li>Give the injection at approximately the same time every day.</li>
<li>Administer only 1 dose (the entire contents of 1 prefilled glass syringe) per day. Discard any unused portions as the drug
            contains no preservative. Do not save unused drug.
         </li>
<li>Do not permit vaccination with live vaccines while taking anakinra.</li>
<li>Withhold drug and notify physician for S&amp;S of upper respiratory, skin, or other infection(s).</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
