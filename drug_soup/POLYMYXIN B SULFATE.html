<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>500,000 unit injection; 500,000 unit ophthalmic solution</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Antibiotic derived from strains of <i>Bacillus polymyxa.</i> Binds to lipid phosphates in bacterial membranes and, through cationic detergent action, changes permeability to permit leakage
         of cytoplasm.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Bactericidal against susceptible gram negative organisms, particularly most strains of <i>Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter aerogenes,</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae.</i> Most species of <i>Proteus</i> and <i>Neisseria</i> are resistant, as are all gram-positive organisms and fungi.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Topically and in combination with other antiinfectives or corticosteroids for various superficial infections of eye, ear,
         mucous membrane, and skin. Concurrent systemic antiinfective therapy may be required for treatment of intraocular infection
         and severe progressive corneal ulcer. Used parenterally only in hospitalized patients for treatment of severe acute infections
         of urinary tract, bloodstream, and meninges; and in combination with Neosporin for continuous bladder irrigation to prevent
         bacteremia associated with use of indwelling catheter.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to polymyxin antibiotics; concurrent and sequential use of other nephrotoxic and neurotoxic drugs; concurrent
         use of skeletal muscle relaxants, ether, or sodium citrate. Safety during pregnancy (category B) or children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Impaired kidney function; myasthenia gravis; lactation.</p>

<li>Routine administration by IM routes not recommended because it causes intense discomfort, along the peripheral nerve distribution,
            4060 min after IM injection.
         </li>
<li>Make IM injection in adults deep into upper outer quadrant of buttock. Select IM site carefully to avoid injection into nerves
            or blood vessels. Rotate injection sites. Follow agency policy for IM site used in children.

<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Obtain C&amp;S tests prior to first dose and periodically thereafter to determine continuing sensitivity of causative
            organisms. Perform baseline serum electrolytes and kidney function tests before parenteral therapy. Frequent monitoring of
            kidney function and serum drug levels is advised during therapy. Monitor electrolytes at regular intervals during prolonged
            therapy.
         </li>
<li>Review electrolyte results. Patients with low serum calcium and low intracellular potassium are particularly prone to develop
            neuromuscular blockade.
         </li>
<li>Inspect tongue every day. Assess for S&amp;S of superinfection (see Appendix F). Polymyxin therapy supports growth of opportunistic
            organisms. Report symptoms promptly.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O. Maintain fluid intake sufficient to maintain daily urinary output of at least 1500 mL. Some degree of renal toxicity
            usually occurs within first 3 or 4 d of therapy even with therapeutic doses. Consult physician.
         </li>
<li>Withhold drug and report findings to physician for any of the following: Decreases in urine output (change in I&amp;O ratio),
            proteinuria, cellular casts, rising BUN, serum creatinine, or serum drug levels (not associated with dosage increase). All
            can be interpreted as signs of nephrotoxicity.
         </li>
<li>Nephrotoxicity is generally reversible, but it may progress even after drug is discontinued. Therefore, close monitoring of
            kidney function is essential, even following termination of therapy.
         </li>
<li>Be alert for respiratory arrest after the first dose and also as long as 45 d after initiation of therapy. It occurs most
            commonly in patients with kidney failure and high plasma drug levels and is often preceded by dyspnea and restlessness.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report to physician immediately any muscle weakness, shortness of breath, dyspnea, depressed respiration. These symptoms are
            rapidly reversible if drug is withdrawn.
         </li>
<li>Stop drug administration immediately and report to physician if you experience eyelid irritation, itching, and burning with
            ophthalmic drops.
         </li>
<li>Report promptly to physician transient neurologic disturbances (burning or prickling sensations, numbness, dizziness). All
            occur commonly and usually respond to dosage reduction.
         </li>
<li>Report promptly to physician the onset of stiff neck and headache (possible symptoms of neurotoxic reactions, including neuromuscular
            blockade). This response is usually associated with high serum drug levels or nephrotoxicity.
         </li>
<li>Report promptly S&amp;S of superinfection (see Appendix F).</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
