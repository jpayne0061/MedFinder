<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Adalimumab is a DNA recombinant cytokine that binds to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and blocks its interaction with cell
         surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also modulates changes in levels of cell adhesion molecules needed for WBC migration out
         of the circulatory system to sites of inflammation. In the presence of complement, adalimumab may also lyse TNF-expressing
         cells.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Reduces the levels of acute phase inflammatory reactants (C-reactive protein, ESR, interleukin-6) thus decreasing overall
         joint inflammation; also reduces levels of enzymes that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction. In
         RA, adalimumab reduces the numerous inflammatory events of polyarthritis. It reduces the overproduction of TNF-alpha principally
         by macrophages in rheumatoid joints.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and to reduce progression of the disease in patients that have had an
         inadequate response to at least one disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>

<li>Do not administer to persons with active infections. Evaluate for latent TB with TB skin test prior to initiation of therapy.</li>
<li>Inspect prefilled syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to SC injection.</li>
<li>Rotate injection sites and do not inject into skin that is red, bruised, tender, or hard. After injecting the drug, do not
            rub the site.
         </li>
<li>Discard any remaining solution in prefilled syringe, as it contains no preservatives.</li>
<li>Store in original carton at 2°4° C (38°48° F). Protect from light. Do not use beyond the expiration
            date.
