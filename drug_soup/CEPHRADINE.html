<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>250 mg, 500 mg capsules; 125 mg/5 mL, 250 mg/5 mL suspension; 250 mg, 500 mg, 1 g, 2 g injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Semisynthetic acid-stable, first generation, broad-spectrum cephalosporin similar to cefazolin. Preferentially binds to one
         or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) located on cell walls of susceptible organisms. This inhibits third and final
         stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis, thus killing the bacterium. Cross-allergenicity between cephalosporins and penicillins
         has been reported.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>It is active against many gram-positive aerobic cocci and much less active against gram-negative bacteria. Effectively treats
         bone infections, otitis media, respiratory tract infections, septicemia and skin infections, and urinary tract infections,
         reducing or eliminating infection.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Serious infections of respiratory and urinary tracts, skin and soft tissues, and for otitis media caused by susceptible pathogens;
         for perioperative prophylaxis, in cesarean section (intraoperative and postoperative); in septicemia (due to <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis,</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>). Also used to treat urinary tract infections due to <i>Klebsiella</i> sp and enterococci <i>(Streptococcus faecalis).</i>
</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins and related antibiotics; pregnancy (category B), lactation. Safe use in children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>History of penicillin or other allergies, particularly to drugs; impaired renal function, sodium restriction (parenteral cephradine).</p>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Determine history of previous hypersensitivity to cephalosporins, penicillins, and other drug allergies before therapy is
            initiated.
         </li>
<li>Inspect IV insertion site frequently for thrombophlebitis (see Signs &amp; Symptoms, Appendix F).</li>
<li>Lab tests: Perform culture and sensitivity tests and renal function studies before and periodically during drug therapy.</li>
<li>Consult physician if patient's creatinine clearance is below normal. Recommended dosage schedule in patients with reduced
            renal function is lowered based on creatinine clearance determinations and severity of infection.
         </li>
<li>Pseudomembranous enterocolitis, a potentially life-threatening superinfection caused by <i>Clostridium difficile,</i> may occur during or after cephalosporin therapy. If diarrhea occurs, check for fever. Report diarrhea and fever promptly.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for signs of superinfection (see Appendix F). Report their appearance promptly.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Take this medication for the full course of therapy as directed by your physician. Therapy is usually continued for at least
            4872 h after you become asymptomatic.
         </li>
<li>Superinfections caused by overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms may occur. Report early S&amp;S (see Appendix F) promptly.</li>
<li>Report loose stools or diarrhea promptly.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
