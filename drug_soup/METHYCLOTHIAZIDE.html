<p>2.5 mg, 5 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Thiazide diuretic which is similar to hydrochlorothiazide. Diuretic effect results from a drug-induced inhibition of the renal
         tubular reabsorption of electrolytes. The excretion of sodium and chloride is enhanced. There is also a loss of potassium
         ions via the kidney.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>BP is lowered, probably by the loss of sodium and water, and consequently blood volume. Edema is also decreased in CHF patients
         by the same mechanism.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Antihypertensive treatment and adjunctively in the management of edema associated with CHF, renal pathology, and hepatic cirrhosis.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to thiazides, and sulfonamide derivatives; anuria, hypokalemia, pregnancy (category C), lactation.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Impaired kidney or liver function; gout; SLE; hypercalcemia; diabetes mellitus.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give early in a.m. after eating (reduces gastric irritation) to prevent sleep interruption because of diuresis. If 2 doses
            are ordered, administer second dose no later than 3 p.m.
         </li>
<li>Store at 15°30° C (59°86° F) unless otherwise instructed.</li>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Expect antihypertensive effects in 34 d; maximal effects may require 34 wk.</li>
<li>Monitor BP and I&amp;O ratio during first phase of antihypertensive therapy. Report a sudden fall in BP, which may initiate severe
            postural hypotension and potentially dangerous perfusion problems, especially in the extremities.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Periodic serum electrolytes and CBC with differential.</li>
<li>Monitor patient for S&amp;S of hypokalemia (see Appendix F). Report promptly. Physician may change dose and institute replacement
            therapy.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Eat a balanced diet to protect against hypokalemia; generally not severe even with long-term therapy. Prevent onset by eating
            potassium-rich foods including a banana (about 370 mg potassium) and at least 180 mL (6 oz) orange juice (about 330 mg potassium)
            every day.
         </li>
<li>Watch carefully for loss of glycemic control (diabetics) and early signs of hyperglycemia (see Appendix F). Symptoms are slow
            to develop.
         </li>
<li>Avoid OTC drugs unless the physician approves them. Many preparations contain both potassium and sodium, and may induce electrolyte
            imbalance adverse effects.
         </li>
<li>Older adults are more responsive to excessive diuresis; orthostatic hypotension may be a problem.</li>
<li>Change positions slowly and in stages from lying down to upright positions; avoid hot baths or showers, extended exposure
            to sunlight, and standing still. Accept assistance as necessary to prevent falling.
         </li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in potentially hazardous activities until adjustment to the hypotensive effects of drug has been made.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
