<p>50 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Water-soluble gold compound similar to aurothioglucose in actions and uses. Has immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory effects.
         Action mechanism unclear. Drug appears to act by suppression of phagocytosis, altered immune responses, and possibly by inhibition
         of prostaglandin synthesis.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Intramuscular</span><br/><ul>
<li>Agitate vial before withdrawing dose to ensure uniform suspension.</li>
<li>Give deep into upper outer quadrant of gluteus maximus with patient lying down. Patient should remain recumbent for at least
            30 min after injection because of the danger of "nitritoid reaction" (transient giddiness, vertigo, facial flushing,
            fainting).
         </li>
<li>Observe for allergic reactions.</li>
<li>Store in tight, light-resistant containers at 15°30° C (59°86° F). Do not use if any darker
            than pale yellow.
         </li>

<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Prior to each injection, urinalysis for protein, blood, and sediment. Withhold drug and notify physician promptly
            if proteinuria or hematuria develops. Also do baseline Hgb and RBC, WBC count, differential count, platelet count before initiation
            of therapy and at regular intervals.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Rapid reduction in hemoglobin level, WBC count below 4000/mm<sup>3</sup>, eosinophil count above 5%, and platelet count below 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup> signify possible toxicity.
            						
         </li>
<li>Interview and examine patient before each injection to detect occurrence of transient pruritus or dermatitis (both are common
            early indications of toxicity), stomatitis (sore tongue, palate, or throat), metallic taste, indigestion, or other signs and
            symptoms of possible toxicity. Interrupt treatment immediately and notify physician if any of these reactions occurs.
         </li>
<li>Observe for allergic reaction, which may occur almost immediately after injection, 10 min after injection, or at any time
            during therapy. Withhold drug and notify physician if observed. Keep antidote dimercaprol (BAL) on hand during time of injection.
         </li>

<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Therapeutic effects may not appear until after 2 mo of therapy.</li>
<li>Notify physician of rapid improvement in joint swelling; this is indicative that you are closely approaching drug tolerance
            level.
         </li>
<li>Use protective measures in sunlight. Exposure to sunlight may aggravate gold dermatitis.</li>
<li>Notify physician at the appearance of purpura or ecchymoses; this is always an indication for doing a platelet count.</li>
<li>Know possible adverse reactions and report any symptom suggestive of toxicity immediately to physician.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
