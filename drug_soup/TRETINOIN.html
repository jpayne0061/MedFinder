<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Contact irritant containing retinoic acid and vitamin A acid. Reverses retention hyperkeratosis and comedo formation, primary
         events in acne pathology. Exact mechanism of action unknown. Suggested that keratinocytes in the sebaceous follicle become
         less adherent and turnover of follicular epithelial cells is increased; two processes that promote easy extrusion of the comedo
         and prevent it from reformation. Also increases permeability of skin and supports conversion of follicular epithelium into
         a less sturdy, and almost fragile condition.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Be aware that treatment to dark-skinned individuals may cause unsightly postinflammatory hyperpigmentation; that is reversible
            with termination of drug treatment.
         </li>
<li>Clinical response should be evident in 23 wk; complete and satisfactory response (in 75% of the patients) may require
            34 mo. Once achieved, control is maintained by less frequent applications or a change in formulation or dosage.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Be aware that erythema and desquamation during the first 13 wk of treatment do not represent exacerbation of the skin
            problem but a probable response to the drug from deep previously unseen lesions.
         </li>
<li>As treatment is continued, lesions gradually disappear, leaving an inflammatory background; scaling and redness decrease after
            810 wk of therapy.
         </li>
<li>Wash face no more often than 23 times daily.</li>
<li>Do not use topical preparations with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime, perfumes and shaving lotions
            during treatment period.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that drug is not curative; relapses commonly occur within 36 wk after treatment has been discontinued.</li>
<li>Remove nonmedicated cosmetics thoroughly before drug is applied.</li>
<li>Avoid exposure to sun; when cannot be avoided, use a SPF 15 or higher sunscreen.</li>
<li>Do not self-medicate with additional acne treatment because of danger of drug interactions.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while using or taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
