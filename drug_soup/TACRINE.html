<p>10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Cholinesterase inhibitor, presumably elevates acetylcholine in the cerebral cortex by slowing degradation of acetylcholine
         release by the remaining intact neurons. Balance pathologic changes in neurons that result in deficiency of acetylcholine
         in early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give at least 1 h before meals; bioavailability reduced 3040% when taken with food. Effectiveness depends on administration
            at regular intervals.
         </li>
<li>Titrate dose upward as long as serum transaminase (ALT) levels remain less than or equal to 3 times upper limit of normal
            (ULN).
         </li>
<li>Reduce daily dose by 40 mg/d when ALT exceeds 3 times but is less than or equal to 5 times ULN. Resume titration when ALT
            returns to normal.
         </li>
<li>Stop treatment if ALT exceeds 5 times ULN.</li>
<li>Store at room temperature, 15°30° C (59°86° F), away from moisture.</li>

<li>Monitor for clinical improvement (defined as a 4-point improvement in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale/Cognitive Subscale).
            Improvement has been observed after 14 wk; may take 6 mo for maximum benefit.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Monitor serum transaminase (ALT) levels according to following schedule: Every 2 wk for first 16 wk, then monthly
            for 2 mo, then every 3 mo thereafter; resume weekly monitoring for 6 wk with each dose increase; continue weekly monitoring
            if ALT remains more than 2 times normal; if therapy is interrupted more than 4 wk then restarted, resume full ALT monitoring
            schedule.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O because tacrine may cause bladder outflow obstruction.</li>
<li>Monitor for seizure activity and take appropriate precautions.</li>
<li>Monitor patients with history of angle-closure glaucoma for a worsening of this condition.</li>
<li>Monitor for GI distress and bleeding, especially in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or on concurrent <small>NSAID</small> therapy.
         </li>
<li>Supervise ambulation because dizziness occurs in more than 10% of patients.</li>
<li>Monitor cardiovascular status including periodic ECG monitoring. Assess for fluid retention and worsening of CHF.</li>
<li>Monitor periodically for development of drug-induced diabetes.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Be aware of adverse effects related to initiation of therapy or dosage increases (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) as well
            as delayed effects (e.g., rash, GI bleeding, jaundice). Report adverse effects to the physician.
         </li>
<li>Do not discontinue or reduce dosage of 80 mg/d or more abruptly because it may precipitate acute deterioration of cognitive
            function.
         </li>
<li>Make sure to have regular follow-up and liver function tests.</li>
<li>Tacrine may induce seizures, vertigo, and syncope. Use appropriate precautions.</li>
<li>Understand that tacrine therapy is not a cure and will become ineffective at some point as the disease progresses.</li>
