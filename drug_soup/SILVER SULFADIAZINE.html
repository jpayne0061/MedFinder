<p>1%/50 g cream</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Produced by reaction of silver nitrate with sulfadiazine. Mechanism of action differs from that of either component. Silver
         salt is released slowly and exerts bactericidal effect only on bacterial cell membrane and wall, rather than by inhibiting
         folic acid synthesis; antibacterial activity is not inhibited by <i>p</i>-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Contact with sodium chloride in body tissues and fluids results in slow release of sulfadiazine,
         which may be systemically absorbed from application site.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Broad antimicrobial activity including many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and yeast.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Prevention and treatment of sepsis in second- and third-degree burns.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to other sulfonamides; G6PD deficiency; pregnancy (category C), pregnant women at term, lactation, premature
         infants and neonates

<li>Do not use if cream darkens; it is water soluble and white.</li>
<li>Apply with sterile, gloved hands to cleansed, debrided burned areas. Reapply cream to areas where it has been removed by patient
            activity; cover burn wounds with medication at all times.
         </li>
<li>Bathe patient daily (in whirlpool or shower or in bed) as aid to debridement. Reapply drug.</li>
<li> 				Note: Dressings are not required but may be used if necessary. Drug does not stain clothing. 			</li>
<li>Store at room temperature away from heat.</li>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Observe for and report hypersensitivity reaction: Rash, itching, or burning sensation in unburned areas.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Obtain serum sulfa concentrations, urinalysis, and kidney function tests when drug is applied to extensive areas.
            Significant quantities of drug may be absorbed.
         </li>
<li>Observe patient for reactions attributed to sulfonamides.</li>
<li> 							Note: Analgesic may be required. Occasionally, pain is experienced on application; intensity and duration depend on depth of burn. 						</li>
<li>Continue treatment until satisfactory healing or burn site is ready for grafting, unless adverse reactions occur.</li>
