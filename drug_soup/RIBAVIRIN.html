<p>6 g/100 mL vial; 200 mg tablets; 200 mg capsules; 40 mg/mL oral solution</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Synthetic nucleoside with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against DNA and RNA viruses. Exact mode of action is not fully
         understood but believed to involve multiple mechanisms including selective interference with viral ribonucleic protein synthesis.
         It does not influence interferon synthesis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Active against many RNA and DNA viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, parainfluenza, measles,
         mumps, Lassa fever, enterovirus 72 (formerly called hepatitis A), yellow fever, HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2),
         and vaccinia. Immune responses appear to depend on cellular drug concentrations. Low concentrations seem to stimulate immune
         responses while high concentrations appear to inhibit those responses. Generally not active against poliovirus and coxsackie
         viruses. Unlike other antiviral agents, virus resistance to ribavirin does not appear to develop.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Aerosol treatment of carefully selected hospitalized infants and young children with severe lower respiratory tract infection
         caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Oral used in combination with interferon-alfa to treat hepatitis C and in combination
         with peginterferon alpha for treatment of hepatitis C in patients coinfected with HIV.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A and B, pneumonia caused by adenovirus; Lassa fever, measles, HSV-1, HSV-2, hepatitis
         A, herpes zoster, and for carefully selected patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC).
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Mild RSV infections of lower respiratory tract; infants requiring simultaneous assisted ventilation; severe cardiovascular
         disease, congestive heart failure, angina, unstable cardiac disease; pancreatitis, prolonged or multiple courses of ribavirin
         inhalation therapy; autoimmune hepatitis; renal failure, or Cl<sub>cr</sub>
</p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>COPD, asthma; anemia; history of MI, cardiac arrhythmias; older adults, decreased renal, hepatic, or cardiac function; respiratory
         depression.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1>
<p>
         			Note: Aerosol solution is prepared with either sterile water for injection or sterile water for inhalation, without preservatives
         or any other added substance. See manufacturer's package insert for preparation directions. Inspect solution for discoloration
         or presence of particulate matter. Discard discolored or cloudy solutions.
         		
      </p><span class="adminroutetype">Inhalation</span><br/><ul>
<li>Administer only by SPAG-2 aerosol generator, following manufacturer's directions.</li>
<li>Caution: Ribavirin has demonstrated teratogenicity in animals. Advise pregnant healthcare personnel of the potential teratogenic
            risks associated with exposure during ribavirin administration to patients.
         </li>
<li>Do not give other aerosol medication concomitantly with ribavirin.</li>
<li>Discard solution in the SPAG-2 reservoir at least q24h and whenever liquid level is low before fresh reconstituted solution
            is added.
         </li>
<li>Store unopened vial in a dry place at 15°25° C (59°78° F) unless otherwise directed.</li>
<li>Following reconstitution, store solution at 20°30° C (68°86° F) for 24 h.</li>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain specimens for rapid diagnosis of RSV infection before therapy is initiated or at least during the first 24 h of ribavirin
            therapy. Do not continue therapy without laboratory confirmation of RSV infection.
         </li>
<li>Treatment efficacy in RSV infections appears greatest if initiated within the first 3 d.</li>
<li>Monitor respiratory function and fluid status closely during therapy. Note baseline rate and character of respirations and
            pulse. Observe for signs of labored breathing: dyspnea, apnea; rapid, shallow respirations, intercostal and substernal retraction,
            nasal flaring, limited excursion of lungs, cyanosis. Auscultate lungs for abnormal breath sounds.
         </li>
<li>Observe patients requiring simultaneous assisted ventilation closely for S&amp;S of worsening pulmonary function. Check equipment
            carefully every 2 h, including endotracheal tube, for malfunction. Precipitation of ribavirin and accumulation of fluid in
            tubing can obstruct the apparatus and cause inadequate ventilation and gas exchange.
         </li>
<li>Consult physician about management of fluid and food intake and keep an accurate record of I&amp;O.</li>
