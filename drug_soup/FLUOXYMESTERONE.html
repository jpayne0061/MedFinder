<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Short-acting, orally effective derivative of testosterone with hypercholesterolemic effect. Retention of sodium is minimal;
         thus hypertension and edema rarely complicate therapy.

<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Replacement therapy for endogenous testosterone. Promotes recalcification of osseous metastases and regression of soft tissue
         lesions.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>In men as replacement therapy in conditions associated with testicular hormone deficiency; in women to antagonize effects

<ul>
<li>Lab test: Obtain baseline and periodic liver function and serum electrolytes, Hgb, Hct, and serum and urine calcium; also
            serial serum cholesterol in patients with history of MI or coronary artery disease.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O ratio and pattern and weight, and check for edema; report significant changes.</li>
<li>Monitor for S&amp;S of hypercalcemia (see Appendix F); particularly likely in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma. Stop
            anabolic therapy if it develops.
         </li>
<li>Be alert for voice change in female patient, an early sign of virilism. Virilism may be irreversible even after prompt discontinuation
            of therapy.
         </li>
<li> 							Note: When used in pediatric patients, therapy is preceded by x-ray of wrist bones to establish level of bone maturation. During
            treatment, bone maturation may proceed more rapidly than linear growth; therefore, intermittent dosage schedule and periodic
            x-rays are usual. 						
         </li>
<li>Observe children 
         </li><li>Watch for symptoms of hypoglycemia (see Appendix F) and report to physician. Anabolic treatment may reduce blood glucose in
            diabetic patients.
         </li>
<li>Observe patient on concomitant anticoagulant therapy for ecchymotic areas, petechiae, or abnormal bleeding from any site.
            Close monitoring of PT &amp; INR is essential.
         </li>
<li> 							Note: When used for palliation of mammary cancer, subjective effects of therapy may not be experienced for 1 mo; objective symptoms
            may be delayed for as long as 3 mo. 						
         </li>
<li>Be aware that anabolic response may be evidenced by euphoria and gain in weight and appetite, especially in emaciated and
            debilitated patient.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Adhere to scheduled appointments for laboratory tests.</li>
<li>Good personal hygiene, including meticulous skin care is very important (females and prepubertal males are especially likely
            to develop acne).
         </li>
<li>Note and report symptoms of jaundice (see Appendix F) to physician. Dose adjustment may reverse the condition.</li>
<li>Report menstrual irregularities.</li>
<li>Keep child's appointments for bone maturation studies (usually every 36 mo) to prevent compromised adult height.</li>
<li>Report priapism (prolonged erection) to physician promptly, it is a symptom of overdosage. A temporary interruption of regimen
            may be indicated. Also report persistent GI distress, diarrhea, or the onset of jaundice.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that virilization usually occurs. Report to physician any voice change (hoarseness or deepening), increased libido
            (associated with clitoral enlargement), hirsutism immediately. Usually, stopping therapy will end further development of symptoms
            but will not reverse hirsutism or voice change.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
