<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>0.5 g tablet</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Sulfonamide-derivative renal tubular blocking agent. In sufficiently high doses, competitively inhibits renal tubular reabsorption
         of uric acid, thereby promoting its excretion and reducing serum urate levels.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Prevents formation of new tophaceous deposits and causes gradual shrinking of old tophi by preventing uric acid build-up in
         the serum and tissues. As an additive to penicillin, it increases the serum concentration of the antibiotic, and also prolongs
         the serum concentration of the penicillins.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Hyperuricemia in chronic gouty arthritis and tophaceous gout.</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjuvant to therapy with penicillin G and penicillin analogs to elevate and prolong plasma concentrations of these antibiotics;
         to promote uric acid excretion in hyperuricemia secondary to administration of thiazides and related diuretics, furosemide,
         ethacrynic acid, pyrazinamide.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Blood dyscrasias; uric acid kidney stones; during or within 23 wk of acute gouty attack; over excretion of uric acid
         (&gt;1000 mg/d); patients with creatinine clearance 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>History of peptic ulcer.</p>

<li>Therapy is usually not initiated during an acute gouty attack. Consult physician.</li>
<li>Minimize GI adverse effects by giving after meals, with food, milk, or antacid (prescribed). If symptoms persist, dosage reduction
            may be required.
         </li>
<li>Give with a full glass of water if not contraindicated.</li>
<li>Be aware that physician may prescribe concurrent prophylactic doses of colchicine for first 36 mo of therapy because
            frequency of acute gouty attacks may increase during first 612 mo of therapy.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Decrease daily dosage with caution by 0.5 g q6mo to lowest effective dosage that maintains stable serum urate levels when
            gouty attacks have been absent for 6 mo or more and serum urate levels are controlled.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Periodic serum urate levels, Hct and Hgb, and urinalysis. Determine acidbase balance periodically when urinary
            alkalinizers are used. Some physicians prescribe acetazolamide at bedtime to keep urine alkaline and dilute throughout night.
         </li>
<li>Patients taking sulfonylureas may require dosage adjustment. Probenecid enhances hypoglycemic actions of these drugs (see
            <small>DIAGNOSTIC TEST INTERFERENCES</small>).
         </li>
<li>Expect urate tophaceous deposits to decrease in size. Classic locations are in cartilage of ear pinna and big toe, but they
            can occur in bursae, tendons, skin, kidneys, and other tissues.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Drink fluid liberally (approximately 3000 mL/d) to maintain daily urinary output of at least 2000 mL or more. This is important
            because increased uric acid excretion promoted by drug predisposes to renal calculi.
         </li>
<li>Physician may advise restriction of high-purine foods during early therapy until uric acid level stabilizes. Foods high in
            purine include organ meats (sweetbreads, liver, kidney), meat extracts, meat soups, gravy, anchovies, and sardines. Moderate
            amounts are present in other meats, fish, seafood, asparagus, spinach, peas, dried legumes, wild game.
         </li>
<li>Avoid alcohol because it may increase serum urate levels.</li>
<li>Do not stop taking drug without consulting physician. Irregular dosage schedule may sharply elevate serum urate level and
            precipitate acute gout.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that lifelong therapy is usually required in patients with symptomatic hyperuricemia. Keep scheduled appointments
            with physician and for kidney function and hematology lab work.
         </li>
<li>Report symptoms of hypersensitivity to physician. Discontinuation of drug is indicated.</li>
<li>Do not take aspirin or other OTC medications without consulting physician. If a mild analgesic is required, acetaminophen
            is usually allowed.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
