<p>40 g/150 mL injection; 10%, 20%, 40% cream; 10%, 25% lotion</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>When present in high concentrations in blood, induces diuresis by elevating osmotic pressure of glomerular filtrate, with
         subsequent decrease in sodium and water reabsorption and promotion of chloride and potassium excretion.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Volume and rate of urine flow is increased. Increased blood toxicity results in transudation of fluid from tissue, including
         brain, cerebrospinal, and intraocular fluid into the blood. When used as an abortifacient, urea (in dextrose) is injected
         into amniotic sac, followed by IV oxytocin at a rate of about 400 mU/min or prostaglandin F<sub>2</sub>.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>To reduce or prevent intracranial pressure (cerebral edema) and intraocular pressure and to prevent acute kidney failure during
         prolonged surgery or trauma. Also transabdominally for aborting second trimester of pregnancy. Topical preparation promotes
         hydration and removal of excess keratin in dry skin and hyperkeratotic conditions.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Severe migraine attacks; acute sickle cell crisis.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Severely impaired liver or kidney function; CHF; active intracranial bleeding; marked dehydration; IV injection into lower
         extremities, especially in older adult patients; topical use for viral skin diseases or impaired circulation. (Contraindications
         for intraamniotic urea: impaired kidney function, frank liver failure, active intracranial bleeding; marked dehydration, diabetes
         mellitus, sickle cell anemia.)
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Safe use in pregnancy (category C), lactation, or in children is not established. Use on face or broken skin.</p>

<ul>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O. If diuresis does not occur within 612 h following administration or if BUN exceeds 75 mg/dL, withhold drug
            and notify physician so that kidney function may be evaluated.
         </li>
<li>Monitor vital signs and mental status; promptly report any changes.</li>
<li>Observe postoperative patients closely for signs of hemorrhage. Urea reportedly may increase prothrombin time and promote
            internal oozing at suture sites.
         </li>
<li>Withhold oral fluids and consult physician for hydration parameters if patient complains of a headache.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Serum electrolytes and urinary sodium q12h. Frequent kidney function studies are advised, particularly in patients
            suspected of having kidney dysfunction.
         </li>
<li>Watch for S&amp;S of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, dehydration, or transient overhydration (due to hyperosmotic activity) (see Appendix
            F).
         </li>
<li>Monitor for complaints of lower abdominal pain following intraamniotic instillation. If patient complains of lower abdominal
            pain, it may be that drug is going into abdomen rather than into the amniotic sac.
         </li>
<li>See mannitol for additional nursing implications.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Drink fluids to hasten excretion of urea. However, if a headache develops, stop drinking because the fluid intake may be counteracting
            the effects of the drug. Alert physician.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
