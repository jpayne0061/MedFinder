<p>50 mg capsules; 50 mg/mL suspension; 15 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Rapid-acting thiazide nondiuretic hypotensive and hyperglycemic agent. In contrast to thiazide diuretics, causes sodium and
         water retention and decreases urinary output, probably because it increases proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and decreases
         glomerular filtration rate. Hypotensive effect may be accompanied by marked reflex increase in heart rate, cardiac output,
         and stroke volume; thus cerebral and coronary blood flow are usually maintained.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Reduces peripheral vascular resistance and BP by direct vasodilatory effect on peripheral arteriolar smooth muscles, perhaps
         by direct competition for calcium receptor sites.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Intravenously for emergency lowering of BP in hospitalized patients with malignant hypertension, particularly when associated
         with renal impairment. Not effective in pheochromocytoma. Commonly used with a diuretic such as furosemide (Lasix) to counteract
         diazoxide-induced sodium and water retention. Orally in treatment of various diagnosed hypoglycemic states due to hyperinsulinism
         when other medical treatment or surgical management has been unsuccessful or is not feasible.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to diazoxide or to other thiazides; cerebral bleeding, eclampsia; aortic coarctation; AV shunt, significant
         coronary artery disease. Safe use during pregnancy (category C) or lactation is not established. Use of oral diazoxide for
         functional hypoglycemia or in presence of increased bilirubin in newborns.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Diabetes mellitus; impaired cerebral or cardiac circulation; impaired renal function; patients taking corticosteroids or estrogenprogestogen
         combinations; hyperuricemia, history of gout, uremia.

<ul>
<li>Monitor for therapeutic effectiveness. Discontinue if not effective in 2 or 3 wk.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Initial blood glucose, serum electrolytes, and CBC and at regular intervals in patients receiving multiple doses.</li>
<li>Monitor BP q5min for the first 1530 min or until stabilized, then hourly for balance of drug effect.</li>
<li>Notify physician immediately if BP continues to fall 30 min or more after IV drug administration. Cause other than drug effect
            is probable.
         </li>
<li>Monitor pulse: Tachycardia has occurred immediately following IV; palpitation and bradycardia have also been reported.</li>
<li>Report promptly any change in I&amp;O ratio.</li>
<li>Observe patient closely for S&amp;S of CHF (see Appendix F).</li>
<li>Monitor diabetics carefully for loss of glycemic control.</li>
<li>Evaluate serum electrolyte levels at regular intervals, particularly in patients with impaired renal function; hypokalemia
            potentiates hyperglycemic effect of diazoxide.
         </li>
<li> 								Note: In contrast to IV diazoxide, oral administration usually does not produce marked effects on BP. However, do make periodic
            measurements of BP and vital signs. 							
         </li>
<li>Monitor S&amp;S for up to 7 d for both oral and parenteral forms; essential because of long half-life of diazoxide.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li> 								Note: Drug may cause hyperglycemia and glycosuria in diabetic and diabetic-prone individuals. Closely monitor blood and urine glucose;
            report any abnormalities to physician. 							
         </li>
<li>Report palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, fainting, or severe headache.</li>
<li> 								Note: Lanugo-type hirsutism occurs frequently, commonly in children and women. It is reversible with discontinuation of drug. 							</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
