<p>4 mg, 8 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Centrally acting alpha<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist. Pharmacologic actions closely resemble those of clonidine. Lowers BP, primarily, by stimulating central
         alpha-adrenergic receptors which leads to inhibition of sympathetic outflow from brain. Has no effect on exercise tolerance
         or on potassium levels. It does not cause sodium retention or excretion; however, it appears to enhance urinary dilution and
         free water diuresis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Given the fact that central adrenergic hyperactivity causes symptoms of narcotic withdrawal, guanabenz appears to help control
         abstinence symptoms by reducing norepinephrine output. Reduces both supine and standing BP, usually without producing postural
         hypotension, and slightly lowers pulse rate.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Used alone in treatment of hypertension or in combination with a thiazide diuretic.</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Opiate detoxification, analgesic for chronic pain.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Safe use during pregnancy (category C), lactation, or in children is not established.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Severe coronary insufficiency, recent MI, cerebrovascular disease, severe hepatic or renal failure.</p>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor BP and HR. Report palpitations or hypotension to physician.</li>
<li>Evaluate mental status and alertness.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Baseline and periodic blood chemistry (serum potassium, CBC, creatinine, uric acid, cholesterol, glucose), urinalysis
            for protein and sugar, and ECG.
         </li>
<li>Give early attention and specific treatment to dry mouth. It can interfere with patient's food and fluid intake; deprivation
            of normal salivary flow is a potential dental hazard since it favors demineralization of teeth; and it can be a factor in
            noncompliance.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Make all position changes slowly and in stages in the event that you experience orthostatic hypotension. This is important
            in older adults, who tend to be more sensitive to normal adult doses of antihypertensive drugs because of deficient baroreceptor
            reflexes.
         </li>
<li>Do not omit a dose or stop drug therapy without consulting physician. Do not discontinue therapy abruptly; can cause sympathetic
            overactivity (anxiety, nervousness, palpitation, chest pain, fast or irregular heartbeat, trembling, flushing, headache, increased
            sweating and salivation, elevation of BP, usually above basal level).
         </li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in potentially hazardous activities until response to drug is known. Also, guanabenz may reduce tolerance
            to alcohol and other CNS depressants.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
