<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>3 mg capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Strongly lipophilic and almost neutral in solution, properties that may facilitate transport of agent across cell membranes.
         Action appears to be immunomodulatory: serum immunoglobulin concentrations and rheumatoid factor titers are decreased; and
         antiinflammatory: gold is taken up by macrophages with resulting inhibition of phagocytosis and lysosomal enzyme release.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Auranofin is immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Management of active stage of classic or definite rheumatoid arthritis in adults who do not respond to or tolerate other antiarthritis
         agents (e.g., <small>NSAID</small>s, other gold compounds).
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, active SLE, psoriatic arthritis.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>History of gold-induced necrotizing enterocolitis, renal disease, exfoliative dermatitis or bone marrow aplasia; patient who
         has recently received radiation therapy, history of severe toxicity from previous exposure to gold or other heavy metals.
         Safety during pregnancy (category C), lactation, or by children is not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease, rash, liver disease, history of bone marrow depression; older adults; diabetes mellitus, CHF.</p>

<ul>
<li>Monitor for therapeutic effectiveness which develops slowly and is not usually apparent for 34 mo.</li>
<li>Report any of the following S&amp;S promptly: unexplained bleeding or bruising, metallic taste, sore mouth; pruritus, rash; diarrhea
            and melena; yellow skin and sclera; unexplained cough or dyspnea.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Test for signs of possible impending gold toxicity including decreased Hgb; leukocytes 3; granulocytes 3; platelets 3; proteinuria 
         </li><li>
            							Note: Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is usually spontaneously reversible several weeks after drug is withdrawn.
            						
         </li>
<li>Continue medical surveillance and supportive therapy after drug is discontinued because adverse effects (such as difficulty
            in breathing, diarrhea and abdominal pain, fatigue, weakness, unexplained bleeding and bruising, metallic taste) may persist
            for many months.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report adverse effects of therapy, especially abdominal cramping and pain; discontinuance of therapy may be necessary.</li>
<li>Report metallic taste and pruritus with or without rash. These are among earliest symptoms of impending gold toxicity.</li>
<li>Do not change dosage (dose or dose interval) by omission, increase, or decrease without first consulting physician.</li>
<li>Use antidiarrheal OTC drug and high-fiber diet for drug-induced diarrhea.</li>
<li>Avoid exposure to sunlight (especially between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) or to artificial ultraviolet light to prevent photosensitivity
            reaction.
         </li>
<li>Rinse mouth with water frequently for symptomatic treatment of mild stomatitis. Avoid commercial mouth rinses; clean teeth
            with soft tooth brush and gentle brushing to avoid gingival trauma. Floss at least once daily.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
