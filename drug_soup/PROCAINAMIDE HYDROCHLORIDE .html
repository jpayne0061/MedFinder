<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>250 mg, 375 mg, 500 mg tablets, capsules; 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg, 1000 mg sustained release tablets; 100 mg/mL, 500 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Amide analog of procaine hydrochloride with cardiac actions similar to those of quinine. Class IA antiarrhythmic agent. Depresses
         excitability of myocardium to electrical stimulation, reduces conduction velocity in atria, ventricles, and His-Purkinje system.
         Increases duration of refractory period, especially in the atria.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Produces slight change in contractility of cardiac muscle and cardiac output; suppresses automaticity of His-Purkinje ventricular
         muscle. Produces peripheral vasodilation and hypotension, especially with IV use.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Prophylactically to maintain normal sinus rhythm following conversion of atrial flutter or fibrillation by other methods.
         Also to prevent recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, paroxysmal AV junctional rhythm, ventricular
         tachycardia, ventricular and atrial premature contractions. Also cardiac arrhythmias associated with surgery and anesthesia.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Malignant hyperthermia.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Myasthenia gravis; hypersensitivity to procainamide or procaine; blood dyscrasias; complete AV block, second and third degree
         AV block unassisted by pacemaker.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Patient who has undergone electrical conversion to sinus rhythm; hypotension, cardiac enlargement, CHF, MI, coronary occlusion,
         ventricular dysrhythmia from digitalis intoxication; hepatic or renal insufficiency; electrolyte imbalance; bronchial asthma;
         history of SLE. Safety during pregnancy (category C) or lactation is not established.

<li>Give first PO dose at least 4 h after last IV dose</li>

<ul>
<li>Check apical radial pulses before each dose during period of adjustment to the oral route.</li>
<li>Patients with severe heart, liver, or kidney disease and hypotension are at particular risk for adverse effects.</li>
<li>Monitor the patient's ECG and BP continuously during IV drug administration.</li>
<li>Discontinue IV drug temporarily when (1) arrhythmia is interrupted, (2) severe toxic effects are present, (3) QRS complex
            is excessively widened (greater than 50%), (4) PR interval is prolonged, or (5) BP drops 15 mm Hg or more. Obtain rhythm
            strip and notify physician.
         </li>
<li>Ventricular dysrhythmias are usually abolished within a few minutes after IV dose and within an hour after PO or IM administration.</li>
<li>Report promptly complaints of chest pain, dyspnea, and anxiety. Digitalization may have preceded procainamide in patients
            with atrial arrhythmias. Cardiotonic glycosides may induce sufficient increase in atrial contraction to dislodge atrial mural
            emboli, with subsequent pulmonary embolism.
         </li>
<li>Therapeutic procainamide blood levels are reached in approximately 24 h if kidney function is normal but are delayed in presence
            of renal impairment.

</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a record of weekly weight. Notify physician if weight gain of 1 kg (2 lb) or more is accompanied by local edema.</li>
<li>Record and report date, time, and duration of fibrillation episodes when taking maintenance doses: Light-headedness, giddiness,
            weakness, or faintness.
         </li>
<li>Keep a record of pulse rates. Report to physician changes in rate or quality.</li>
<li>Report to physician signs of reduced procainamide control: Weakness, irregular pulse, unexplained fatigability, anxiety.</li>
