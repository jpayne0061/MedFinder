<p>108 mg powder for injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Synthetic lung surfactant. Endogenous pulmonary surfactant lowers surface tension on alveolar surfaces during respiration
         and stabilizes the alveoli against collapse at resting pressures.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Deficiency of surfactant causes respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants. Colfosceril lowers minimum surface
         tension on alveolar surfaces and restores pulmonary compliance and oxygenation in premature infants.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Prophylactic treatment of infants with birth weights 1350 g who show evidence of pulmonary immaturity.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Rescue treatment of infants with established RDS; RDS in adults.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Infants who have major congenital abnormalities or who are suspected of having congenital infections.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Intratracheal</span><br/><ul>
<li>Reconstitute immediately before use if possible. Use only supplied diluent for reconstitution.</li>
<li>Reconstitute as follows: (1) withdraw diluent with 1819-gauge needle attached to 1012-mL syringe; (2) inject into
            vial by allowing vacuum to draw diluent in; (3) do not withdraw needle and aspirate as much of solution as possible back into
            syringe; (4) maintain vacuum and quickly release plunger. Repeat steps 3 and 4 three or four times to ensure adequate mixing.
         </li>
<li>Reconstituted drug is a milky white suspension. Gently shake if needed to resuspend it.</li>
<li>Withdraw entire ordered dose into syringe while maintaining vacuum in vial.</li>
<li>Before administration of drug, ensure that endotracheal tube tip is in the trachea.</li>
<li>Before administration of drug, the infant should be suctioned. If possible, avoid suctioning for 2 h after drug administration.</li>
<li>Drug is administered without interrupting mechanical ventilation. Use side port on the endotracheal tube adaptor.</li>
<li>Administer dose in halves, each half over 12 min. Give first half dose with head in midline position; then turn head
            and torso to the right. Wait 30 s; then return to midline position for second half dose. Give each dose in short bursts timed
            with inspiration. After second half dose, turn head and torso to left for 30 s; then return to midline.
         </li>
<li>Slow or stop drug administration and adjust ventilator rate or F<small>IO</small><sub>2</sub> if any of the following occur: heart rate decreases, infant becomes dusky or agitated, or O<sub>2</sub> saturation drops.
         </li>
<li>Store at 15°30° C (59°86° F) in a dry place. Reconstituted solution is stable for 12 h.</li>

<ul>
<li>During administration of drug, continuous ECG and transcutaneous monitoring are required. Also monitor chest expansion and
            facial expression.
         </li>
<li>Monitor pulmonary function during administration. Rapid changes may require immediate adjustment of peak inspiratory pressure,
            ventilator rate, or F<small>IO</small><sub>2</sub>.
         </li>
<li>Monitor continuously for 30 min following administration. Frequent arterial blood gas sampling is required to prevent hyperoxia
            and hypocarbia.
