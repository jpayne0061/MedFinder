<p>Topical sulfonamide derivative effective against both grampositive and gram-negative drugs. Topical applications produce marked
         reduction of bacterial growth in vascular tissue. Active in presence of pus and serum and not affected by changes in pH of
         tissue environment. Cross-sensitivity with other sulfonamides not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Bacteriostatic against many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</i> and certain strains of anaerobes.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjunctive therapy in second- and third-degree burns to prevent sepsis.</p>

<li>Apply cream or solution aseptically to cleansed, debrided burn areas with sterile gloved hand.</li>

<li>Store in tight, light-resistant containers. Avoid extremes of temperature.</li>

<ul>
<li>Monitor vital signs. Report immediately changes in BP, pulse, and respiratory rate and volume.</li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O. Report oliguria or changes in I&amp;O ratio and pattern.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Monitor fluid and electrolyte status throughout therapy; acidbase balance should be monitored in patients
            with extensive burns and in those with pulmonary or kidney dysfunction.
         </li>
<li>Be alert to S&amp;S of metabolic acidosis (see Appendix F).</li>
<li>Be alert to evidence of superinfections (see Appendix F), particularly in and below burn eschar.</li>
<li>Observe carefully; accuracy is critical. It is frequently difficult to distinguish between adverse reactions to mafenide and
            the effects of severe burns.
         </li>
<li> 							Note: Allergic reactions have reportedly occurred 1014 d after initiation of mafenide therapy. Temporary discontinuation of
            drug may be necessary. 						
         </li>
<li>Report intense local pain to physician; pain caused by drug may require administration of analgesic.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Apply only a thin dressing over burns unless otherwise directed.</li>
<li>Therapy is usually continued until healing is progressing well (usually 60 d) or site is ready for grafting (after about 3540
            d). It is not withdrawn while there is a possibility of infection unless adverse reactions intervene.
         </li>
<li>Report any of the following to the physician immediately: Foul smelling drainage from wounds, bleeding at wound site, unexplained
            fever.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while using this drug.</li>
