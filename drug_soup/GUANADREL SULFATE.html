<p>10 mg, 25 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Adrenergic ganglionic blocking agent structurally and pharmacologically related to guanethidine. It blocks the release of
         norepinephrine from adrenal medulla and adrenergic nerve endings that normally follows sympathetic nerve stimulation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Blocking the release of norepinephrine leads to catecholamine depletion with resulting relaxation of vascular smooth muscle,
         reduction of peripheral vascular resistance, lowering of systolic and diastolic BP, and a relative increase in parasympathetic
         tone. Decreases standing more than supine BP and is more effective in lowering systolic than diastolic BP.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Stepped-care approach: Step 2 treatment of hypertension, usually with a diuretic.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Pheochromocytoma, CHF, patients taking <small>MAO INHIBITORS</small>. Safe use during pregnancy (category B), lactation, or in children is not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Cerebrovascular, coronary artery, or peripheral vascular disease, bronchial asthma, history of peptic ulcer, diarrhea, older
         adult patients.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor and record BP in supine position and after standing 220 min. Record baseline measurements for future comparison
            purposes.
         </li>
<li>Evaluate the full effect of guanadrel on standing (orthostatic) BP carefully before discharging the hospitalized patient.
            For ambulatory patients, take BP measurements following exercise for complete assessment.
         </li>
<li>Monitor patients closely with cerebrovascular, coronary artery, or peripheral vascular disease because they are particularly
            prone to orthostatic hypotension.
         </li>
<li>Monitor weight gain and assess for edema formation. Guanadrel tends to enhance sodium and water retention, but these effects
            are generally controlled by concurrent diuretic therapy.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Be aware of the possibility of orthostatic hypotension; do not get out of bed without assistance during initial dosage adjustment
            period. Make position changes slowly and in stages, especially from recumbent to upright posture throughout drug therapy.
         </li>
<li>Lie down immediately at first hint of faintness, dizziness, weakness, or light-headedness. All are possible manifestations
            of orthostatic hypotension.
         </li>
<li>Monitor weight, check legs and ankles for edema, and note if rings or shoes suddenly seem too tight. Notify physician of peripheral
            edema or unexpected weight gain of <img src="../images/special/greaterorequal.gif"/>1 kg (2 lb)/d.
         </li>
<li>Take drug at the same time(s) each day, in relation to a daily routine activity.</li>
<li>
            							Note: Most adverse effects disappear or at least diminish in intensity after about 8 wk of therapy.
            						
         </li>
<li>Do not use OTC drugs for treatment of colds, allergy, asthma, or appetite suppressants without consulting the physician or
            pharmacist. Many of these products contain adrenergic (sympathomimetic) amines, which may interfere with hypotensive action
            of guanadrel.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
