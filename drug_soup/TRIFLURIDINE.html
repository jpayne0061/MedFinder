<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Expect epithelial eye infections to respond to therapy within 27 d, with complete healing occurring in 12 wk.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Inform physician of progress and keep follow-up appointments. Herpetic eye infections have a tendency to recur and can lead
            to corneal damage if not adequately treated.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
