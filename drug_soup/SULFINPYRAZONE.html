<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>100 mg tablets; 200 mg capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Potent renal tubular blocking agent of uric acid in the kidney that lowers serum blood level. Like all uricosurics, low doses
         may inhibit tubular secretion of uric acid and cause urate retention. Inhibits release of adenosine diphosphate and 5-hydroxytryptophan,
         and thus decreases platelet adhesiveness and increases platelet survival time; has no effect on prothrombin or blood clotting
         time.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Promotes urinary excretion of uric acid and reduces serum urate levels by competitively inhibiting tubular reabsorption of
         uric acid in the kidney.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Maintenance therapy in chronic gouty arthritis and tophaceous gout.</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Drug-induced hyperuricemia, to decrease platelet aggregation and increase their survival in prevention of TIAs and stroke.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Known hypersensitivity to phenylbutazone, or pyrazoline derivatives; active peptic ulcer; concurrent administration of salicylates;
         blood dyscrasias; patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mg/min, treatment of hyperuricemia secondary to neoplastic
         disease or cancer chemotherapy.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Impaired kidney function; history of healed peptic ulcer; use in conjunction with sulfonamides and sulfonylureas; pregnancy
         (category C), lactation.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give with meals, milk, or antacid (prescribed) to prevent local drug irritant effect. Severity and frequency of symptoms increase
            with dosage. Persistence of GI symptoms may require discontinuation of drug.
         </li>
<li>Ensure fluid intake sufficient to support urinary output of at least 20003000 mL/d during early therapy (consult physician).
            Also alkalinize urine (e.g., with large doses vitamin C) to increase solubility of uric acid and minimize risk of uric acid
            stones.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor therapy using serum urate levels (lower to about 6 mg/dL) to reduce joint changes, tophi formation, and frequency
            of acute attacks and to improve kidney function.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Obtain periodic blood cell counts during prolonged therapy. Also kidney function, particularly with renal impairment.
            Monitor PT and INR with concurrent warfarin use.
         </li>
<li>Frequency of acute gouty attacks may increase during first 612 mo of therapy, even when serum urate levels appear to
            be controlled. Concurrent prophylactic doses of colchicine may be prescribed during first 36 mo of treatment to prevent
            or lessen severity of attacks.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Remain under close medical supervision; therapy is continued indefinitely.</li>
<li>Do not experiment with dosage; subtherapeutic doses may enhance urate retention and large doses may increase risk of toxicity.</li>
<li>Continue medication without interruption even during acute gouty attack. Contact physician for concomitant treatment with
            full therapeutic doses of colchicine or other antiinflammatory agent.
         </li>
<li>Avoid aspirin-containing medications. If an analgesic is required (in patients with normal kidney function), acetaminophen
            is generally recommended.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
