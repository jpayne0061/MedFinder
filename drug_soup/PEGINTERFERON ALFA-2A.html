<p>180 mcg/mL vials; 180 mcg prefilled syringes</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Binds to specific cell surface receptors initiating intracellular signaling via a complex cascade leading to rapid activation
         of gene transcription. Interferon-stimulated genes modulate processes leading to inhibition of viral replication in infected
         cells, inhibition of cell proliferation, and immunomodulation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Stimulates production of effector proteins that raises body temperature, and causes reversible decreases in leukocyte and
         platelet counts. Induces antiviral effects by activation of macrophages, natural killer cells, and T-cells, thus boosting
         cellular immunity and suppressing hepatic inflammation and replication of hepatitis C virus.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Chronic hepatitis C with or without <b>ribavirin</b> in patients coinfected with HIV; treatment of patients with BHeAg-positive or -negative chronic hepatitis B.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>

         AIDS); autoimmune thyroid diseases (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroiditis); autoimmune hepatitis; dental work; <i>E. coli</i> hypersensitivity, decompensated hepatic disease prior to or during treatment; in neonates and infants because it contains
         benzyl alcohol; females of childbearing age; lactation; pregnancy (category C); neonates and infants.
      </p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Subcutaneous</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give dose on the same day of each week. Administer SC in the abdomen or thigh and rotate injection sites.</li>
<li>Warm refrigerated vial by rolling in hands for about 1 min. Do not use if particulate matter is visible in the vial or product
            is discolored. Discard any unused portion.
         </li>
<li>Note that manufacturer recommends the following: dose reduction to 135 mcg if neutrophil count 3 and with ANC values 3, treatment should be suspended until ANC values return to more than 1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; dose reduction to 90 mcg if the platelet count is 3 and discontinuation of therapy if platelet count 3. Consult physician.
         </li>
<li>Store in the refrigerator at 36°46° F (2°8° C), do not freeze or shake. Protect from light.
