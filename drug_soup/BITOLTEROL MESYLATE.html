<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>0.8% aerosol, 0.2% solution for inhalation</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle and inhibits the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity (e.g., histamine) from
         lung tissue cells. Cardiovascular effects appear to be similar to or less than those produced by isoproterenol.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Decreases airway resistance and increases vital capacity; bronchodilation is greater and longer in duration than that produced
         by isoproterenol. Produces prolonged bronchodilation as a beta-adrenergic agent.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Prophylaxis and treatment of bronchial asthma and reversible bronchospasm in monotherapy, or concomitantly with theophylline
         or corticosteroids or both.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Safety during pregnancy (category C), lactation, or in children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, convulsive disorders, unusual sensitivity to catecholamines;
         older patients, psychoneurosis; patient with long standing bronchial asthma, and emphysema with degenerative heart disease.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Inhalation</span><br/><ul>
<li>Follow manufacturer's directions for aerosol metered dose inhaler.</li>
<li>Supervise patient a few times to be certain drug delivery is accomplished.</li>
<li>
            				Note: Manufacturer recommends bottle containing the drug be removed from the inhaler and plastic mouthpiece be cleansed in warm
            tap water and thoroughly dried once daily.
            			
         </li>
<li>Avoid contacting eyes with bitolterol. If it should happen, flush out with copious amounts of water.</li>
<li>
            				Note: When an adrenocorticoid inhalation is also being used, administer the two drugs 15 min apart unless otherwise directed by
            physician. This diminishes the risk of fluorocarbon (propellant) toxicity.
            			
         </li>
<li>Store at 15°30° C (59°86° F); protect from freezing.</li>

<ul>
<li>Keep epinephrine 1:1000 readily available until response to drug is known. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions can occur
            with this drug (see Appendix F).
         </li>
<li>Tremors, a common adverse effect and one due to skeletal muscle stimulation, tend to diminish with continued use of bitolterol.
            Some find the effect intolerable.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Overdosage leads to exaggerated adverse effects.

<li>Do not change dose or dose intervals (i.e., do not omit, increase, or decrease number of inhalations). Notify physician immediately
            if condition worsens or if there is no response to the usual dose.
         </li>
<li>Do not use any other inhaler medication (OTC or leftover medication) without physician approval.</li>
