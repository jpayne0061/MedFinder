<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>10 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) produced by recombinant DNA technology. Endogenous G-CSF regulates the
         production of neutrophils within the bone marrow; not species-specific and primarily affects neutrophil proliferation, differentiation
         and selected end-cell functional activity (including enhanced phagocytic activity, antibody-dependent killing, and the increased
         expression of some functions associated with cell-surface antigens).
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Increases neutrophil proliferation and differentiation within the bone marrow.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>To decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies receiving
         myelosuppressive anticancer drugs associated with a significant incidence of severe neutropenia with fever; to decrease neutropenia
         associated with bone marrow transplant; to treat chronic neutropenia.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to <i>Escherichia coli</i>-derived proteins, 14 d before or 24 h after administration of chemotherapy, and myeloid cancers; splenomegaly; ARDS.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Sickle cell disease; pregnancy (category C), lactation. For use in peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilization; neutropenic
         patients with sepsis; leukemia; concurrent lithium therapy.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Subcutaneous</span><br/><ul>
<li>Do not administer filgrastim in the period 14 d before or 24 h after cytotoxic chemotherapy.</li>
<li>Use only one dose per vial; do not reenter the vial.</li>
<li>Prior to injection, filgrastim may be allowed to reach room temperature for a maximum of 6 h. Discard any vial left at room
            temperature for &gt;6 h.
         </li>
<li>Aspirate prior to injection to avoid injection into a blood vessel. Inject SC; do not inject intradermally. Recommended injection
            sites include outer area of upper arms, abdomen (excluding 2-in area around navel), front of middle thighs, and upper outer
            areas of the buttocks.
         </li>
<li>Do not recap needle. Slide needle guard over needle until it is completely covered and needle guard clicks into place.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Store refrigerated at 2°8° C (36°46° F). Do not freeze. Avoid shaking.</li>

<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Obtain a baseline CBC with differential and platelet count prior to administering drug. Obtain CBC twice weekly
            during therapy to monitor neutrophil count and leukocytosis. Monitor Hct and platelet count regularly.
         </li>
<li>Discontinue filgrastim if absolute neutrophil count exceeds 10,000/mm<sup>3</sup> after the chemotherapy-induced nadir. Neutrophil counts should then return to normal.
         </li>
<li>Monitor patients with preexisting cardiac conditions closely. MI and arrhythmias have been associated with a small percent
            of patients receiving filgrastim.
         </li>
<li>Monitor temperature q4h. Incidence of infection should be reduced after administration of filgrastim.</li>
<li>Assess degree of bone pain if present. Consult physician if nonnarcotic analgesics do not provide relief.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report bone pain and, if necessary, request analgesics to control pain.</li>
<li> 							Note: Proper drug administration and disposal is important. A puncture-resistant container for the disposal of used syringes and
            needles should be utilized. 						
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
