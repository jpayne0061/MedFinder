<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Precise mechanism of action is not fully understood; however, current evidence suggests that 1-docosanol inhibits viral replication
         by interfering with the early intracellular events surrounding viral entry into target cells. It is possible that interaction
         between the highly lipophilic compound and components of target cell membranes renders such target cells less susceptible
         to viral fusion or entry.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Believed to exert its anti-viral effect by inhibiting fusion of the HSV (herpes virus) envelope with the human cell plasma
         membrane, therefore making it difficult for the virus to enter the cell and replicate. Thus docosanol-treated cells resist
         infection by the herpes virus.
