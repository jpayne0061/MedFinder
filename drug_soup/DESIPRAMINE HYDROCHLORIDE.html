<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Dibenzoxazepine tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and secondary amine. Desipramine is the active metabolite of imipramine and
         has similar pharmacologic actions. Unlike imipramine, onset of action is more rapid, and it has lower potential for producing
         sedative and anticholinergic effects and orthostatic hypotension.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>In common with other TCAs, antidepressant activity appears to be related to inhibition of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin
         in the CNS. Restoration of the levels of these neurotransmitters is a proposed mechanism of antidepressant action.

<ul>
<li>Monitor for therapeutic effectiveness: Usually not realized until after at least 2 wk of therapy.</li>
<li>Monitor BP and pulse rate during early phase of therapy, particularly in older adult, debilitated, or cardiovascular patients.
            If BP rises or falls more than 20 mm Hg or if there is a sudden increase in pulse rate or change in rhythm, withhold drug
            and inform physician.
         </li>
<li> 								Note: Drowsiness, dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension are signs of impending toxicity in patient on long-term, high dosage therapy.
            Prolonged QT or QRS intervals indicate possible toxicity. Report to physician. 							
         </li>
<li>Observe patient with history of glaucoma. Report symptoms that may signal acute attack: Severe headache, eye pain, dilated
            pupils, halos of light, nausea, vomiting.
         </li>
<li>Monitor bowel elimination pattern and I&amp;O ratio. Severe constipation and urinary retention are potential problems of TCA therapy.</li>
<li> 								Note: Norpramin tablets may contain tartrazine, which can cause allergic-type reactions including bronchial asthma in susceptible
            individuals. Such individuals are frequently also sensitive to aspirin. 							
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Make all position changes slowly and in stages, particularly from recumbent to standing position.</li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until reaction to drug is known.</li>
<li>Take medication exactly as prescribed; do not change dose or dose intervals.</li>
<li> 								Note: Patients who receive high doses for prolonged periods may experience withdrawal symptoms including headache, nausea, musculoskeletal
            pain, and weakness if drug is discontinued abruptly. 							
         </li>
<li>Do not take OTC drugs unless physician has approved their use.</li>
<li>Stop, or at least limit, smoking because it may increase the metabolism of desipramine, thereby diminishing its therapeutic
            action.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
