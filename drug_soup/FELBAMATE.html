<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Obtain baseline values for liver function and complete hematologic studies before initiating therapy, repeat frequently
            during therapy, and for a lengthy period after discontinuation of felbamate. Monitor serum sodium and potassium levels periodically
            because hyponatremia and hypokalemia have been reported.
         </li>
<li>Report immediately any hematologic abnormalities.</li>
<li>Monitor results of hepatic function tests throughout therapy.</li>
<li> 							Note: When used concomitantly with either phenytoin or carbamazepine, carefully monitor serum levels of these drugs when felbamate
            is added, when adjustments in felbamate dosing are made, or when felbamate is discontinued. 						
         </li>
<li> 							Note: A reduction in phenytoin of 1040% is usually needed when felbamate is added to the regimen. 						</li>
<li>Monitor weight, because both weight gain and loss have been reported.</li>
<li>Monitor for S&amp;S of drug toxicity including GI distress and CNS toxicity.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li> 							Note: It is highly recommended that patients and physicians review the indication for treatment, risks associated with the drug,
            and the importance of undergoing regular blood monitoring. 						
         </li>
<li>Report unusual changes (e.g., blurred vision, dysplopia) to physician.</li>
<li>Report S&amp;S of hypersensitivity including pruritus, urticaria, and (rarely) photosensitivity allergic reaction to physician.</li>
