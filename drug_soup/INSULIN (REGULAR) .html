<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>

<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Short-acting, clear, colorless solution of exogenous unmodified insulin extracted from beta cells in pork pancreas or synthesized
         by recombinant DNA technology (human). Enhances transmembrane passage of glucose across cell membranes of most body cells
         and by unknown mechanism may itself enter the cell to activate selected intermediary metabolic processes. Promotes conversion
         of glucose to glycogen.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>It lowers blood glucose levels by increasing peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat tissue, and
         by inhibiting the liver from changing glycogen to glucose.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Emergency treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis or coma, to initiate therapy in patient with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,
         and in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin to provide better control of blood glucose concentrations
         in the diabetic patient. Used IV to stimulate growth hormone secretion (glucose counter regulatory hormone) to evaluate pituitary
         growth hormone reserve in patient with known or suspected growth hormone deficiency. Other uses include promotion of intracellular
         shift of potassium in treatment of hyperkalemia (IV) and induction of hypoglycemic shock as therapy in psychiatry.
      </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to insulin animal protein.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1>
<p>
         			Note: Insulins should not be mixed unless prescribed by physician. In general, regular insulin is drawn up into syringe first. Any
         change in the strength (e.g., U-40, U-100), brand (manufacturer), purity, type (regular, etc.), species (pork, human), or
         sequence of mixing two kids of insulin is made by the physician only, since a simultaneous change in dosage may be necessary.
         		
      </p><span class="adminroutetype">Subcutaneous</span><br/><ul>
<li>Use an insulin syringe.</li>
<li>Give regular insulin 30 min before a meal.</li>
<li>Avoid injection of cold insulin; it can lead to lipodystrophy, reduced rate of absorption, and local reactions.</li>
<li>Common injection sites: Upper arms, thighs, abdomen [avoid area over urinary bladder and 2 in. (5 cm) around navel], buttocks,
            and upper back (if fat is loose enough to pick up). Rotate sites.

<li>Insulin is stable at room temperature up to 1 mo. Avoid exposure to direct sunlight or to temperature extremes [safe range
            is wide: 5°38° C (40°100° F)]. Refrigerate but do not freeze stock supply. Insulin tolerates
            temperatures above 38° C with less harm than freezing.

<li>
            							Note: Frequency of blood glucose monitoring is determined by the type of insulin regimen and health status of the patient.
            						
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Periodic postprandial blood glucose, and HbA<sub>1C</sub>. Test urine for ketones in new, unstable, and type 1 diabetes; if patient has lost weight, exercises vigorously, or has an
            illness; whenever blood glucose is substantially elevated.
         </li>
<li>Notify physician promptly for presence of acetone with sugar in the urine; may indicate onset of ketoacidosis. Acetone without
            sugar in the urine usually signifies insufficient carbohydrate intake.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for hypoglycemia (see Appendix F) at time of peak action of insulin. Onset of hypoglycemia (blood sugar: 5040
            mg/dL) may be rapid and sudden.
         </li>
<li>Check BP, I&amp;O ratio, and blood glucose and ketones every hour during treatment for ketoacidosis with IV insulin.</li>
<li>Give patients with severe hypoglycemia glucagon, epinephrine, or IV glucose 1050%. As soon as patient is fully conscious,
            give oral carbohydrate (e.g., dilute corn syrup or orange juice with sugar, Gatorade, or Pedialyte) to prevent secondary hypoglycemia.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn correct injection technique.</li>
<li>Inject insulin into the abdomen rather than a near muscle that will be heavily taxed, if engaged in active sports.</li>
<li>Notify physician of local reactions at injection site; may develop 13 wk after therapy starts and last several hours
            to days, usually disappear with continued use.
         </li>
<li>Do not change prescription lenses during early period of dosage regulation; vision stabilizes, usually 36 wk.</li>
<li>
            							Note: Hypoglycemia can result from excess insulin, insufficient food intake, vomiting, diarrhea, unaccustomed exercise, infection,
            illness, nervous or emotional tension, or overindulgence in alcohol.
            						
         </li>
<li>Respond promptly to beginning symptoms of hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia is an emergency situation. Take 4 oz (120 mL)
            of any fruit juice or regular carbonated beverage [1.53 oz (4590 mL) for child] followed by a meal of longer-acting
            carbohydrate or protein food. Failure to show signs of recovery within 30 min indicates need for emergency treatment.
         </li>
<li>Carry some form of fast-acting carbohydrate (e.g., lump sugar, Life-Savers or other candy) at all times to treat hypoglycemia.</li>
<li>Check blood glucose regularly during menstrual period; loss of diabetes control (hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia) is common;
            adjust insulin dosage accordingly, as prescribed by physician.
         </li>
<li>Notify physician of S&amp;S of diabetic ketoacidosis.</li>
<li>Continue taking insulin during an illness, go to bed, and drink noncaloric liquids liberally (every hour if possible). Consult
            physician for insulin regulation if unable to eat prescribed diet.
         </li>
<li>Avoid OTC medications unless approved by physician.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
