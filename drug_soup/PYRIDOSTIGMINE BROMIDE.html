<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>60 mg/5 mL syrup; 60 mg tablet; 180 mg extended-release tablet 5 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Analog of neostigmine; indirect-acting cholinergic that inhibits cholinesterase activity. Drug facilitates transmission of
         impulses across myoneural junctions by blocking destruction of acetylcholine. Has fewer adverse effects and longer duration
         of action than neostigmine.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Direct stimulant action on voluntary muscle fibers and possibly on autonomic ganglia and CNS neurons. Produces increased tone
         in skeletal muscles.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Myasthenia gravis and as an antagonist to nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g., curariform drugs).</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to anticholinesterase agents or to bromides. Mechanical obstruction of urinary or intestinal tract; bradycardia,
         hypotension; pregnancy (category C), and lactation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Bronchial asthma; epilepsy; vagotonia; hyperthyroidism; peptic ulcer; cardiac dysrhythmias.</p>

<ul>
<li>Report increasing muscular weakness, cramps, or fasciculations. Failure of patient to show improvement may reflect either
            underdosage or overdosage.
         </li>
<li>Observe patient closely if atropine is used to abolish GI adverse effects or other muscarinic adverse effects because it may
            mask signs of overdosage (cholinergic crisis): Increasing muscle weakness, which through involvement of respiratory muscles
            can lead to death.
         </li>
<li>Monitor vital signs frequently, especially respiratory rate.</li>
<li>Observe for signs of cholinergic reactions (see Appendix F), particularly when drug is administered IV.</li>
<li>Observe neonates of myasthenic mothers, who have received pyridostigmine, closely for difficulty in breathing, swallowing,
            or sucking.
         </li>
<li>Observe patient continuously when used as muscle relaxant antagonist. Airway and respiratory assistance must be maintained
            until full recovery of voluntary respiration and neuromuscular transmission is assured. Complete recovery usually occurs within
            30 min.
