<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>0.5 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL, 10 mg/mL injection; 0.3 mg, 0.4 mg, 0.6 mg sublingual tablets; 0.4 mg/spray translingual spray; 2 mg, 3 mg buccal tablets; 2.5 mg, 6.5 mg, 9 mg, 13 mg sustained-release tablets, capsules; 0.1 mg/h, 0.2 mg/h, 0.3 mg/h, 0.4 mg/h, 0.6 mg/h, 0.8 mg/h transdermal patch; 2% ointment</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Organic nitrate and potent vasodilator that relaxes vascular smooth muscle by unknown mechanism, resulting in dose-related
         dilation of both venous and arterial blood vessels. Promotes peripheral pooling of blood, reduction of peripheral resistance,
         and decreased venous return to the heart. Both left ventricular preload and afterload are reduced and myocardial oxygen consumption
         or demand is decreased.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Therapeutic doses may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean BP; heart rate is usually slightly increased. Produces antianginal,
         antiischemic, and antihypertensive effects.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Prophylaxis, treatment, and management of angina pectoris. IV nitroglycerin is used to control BP in perioperative hypertension,
         CHF associated with acute MI; to produce controlled hypotension during surgical procedures, and to treat angina pectoris in
         patients who have not responded to nitrate or beta-blocker therapy.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Sublingual and topical to reduce cardiac workload in patients with acute MI and in CHF. Ointment for adjunctive treatment
         of Raynaud's disease.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy, or tolerance to nitrates; severe anemia; head trauma, increased ICP; glaucoma (sustained-release
         forms). Also (IV nitroglycerin): hypotension, uncorrected hypovolemia, constrictive pericarditis, pericardial tamponade; pregnancy
         (category C), lactation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Severe liver or kidney disease, conditions that cause dry mouth, early MI.</p>

<p>
         			Note: Drug forms appropriate for angina prophylaxis include ointment, transdermal unit, translingual spray, transmucosal tablet,
         and oral sustained release forms. Drug forms appropriate for acute angina include sublingual tablet, translingual spray, or
         transmucosal tablet.
         		
      </p><span class="adminroutetype">Sublingual Tablet</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give 1 tablet and if pain is not relieved, give additional tablets at 5-min intervals, but not more than 3 tablets in a 15-min
            period.
         </li>
<li>Typically available for self-administration in their original container. Instruct in correct use. Request patient to report
            all attacks. Count tablets daily.
         </li>
<li>Instruct to sit or lie down upon first indication of oncoming anginal pain and to place tablet under tongue or in buccal pouch
            (hypotensive effect of drug is intensified in the upright position).
         </li>
</ul><span class="adminroutetype">Sustained-Release Buccal Tablet</span><br/><ul>
<li>Place tablet between lip and gum above incisors or between cheek and gum allowing slow dissolution over 35 h.</li>
<li>Touching tongue to tablet or drinking hot fluids hastens tablet dissolution, which can lead to decreased duration of medication
            effect and onset of anginal pain.
         </li>
<li>Ensure that tablet is not chewed or swallowed or crushed.</li>
</ul><span class="adminroutetype">Sustained-Release Tablet or Capsule</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give on an empty stomach (1 h before or 2 h after meals), with a full glass of water. Ensure it is swallowed whole.</li>
<li>Be aware that sustained release form helps to prevent anginal attacks; it is not intended for immediate relief of angina.</li>
<li>Ensure that tablet is not crushed or chewed.</li>
</ul><span class="adminroutetype">Translingual Spray</span><br/><ul>
<li>Do not shake canister. Spray preferably on or under tongue. Do not inhale spray.</li>
<li>Repeat spray if needed q5min for a maximum of 3 metered doses.</li>
<li>Instruct to wait at least 10 seconds before swallowing.</li>
</ul><span class="adminroutetype">Transdermal Ointment</span><br/><ul>
<li>Using dose-determining applicator (paper application patch) supplied with package, squeeze prescribed dose onto this applicator.
            Using applicator, spread ointment in a thin, uniform layer to premarked 5.5 by 9 cm (2 <small>1/4</small> by 3 ½ in.) square.
            Place patch with ointment side down onto nonhairy skin surface (areas commonly used: chest, abdomen, anterior thigh, forearm).
            Cover with transparent wrap and secure with tape. Avoid getting ointment on fingers.
         </li>
<li>Rotate application sites to prevent dermal inflammation and sensitization. Remove ointment from previously used sites before
            reapplication.
         </li>
<li>Keep ointment container tightly closed and store in cool place.</li>
</ul><span class="adminroutetype">Transdermal Unit</span><br/><ul>
<li>Apply transdermal unit (transdermal patch) at the same time each day, preferably to skin site free of hair and not subject
            to excessive movement. Avoid abraded, irritated, or scarred skin. Clip hair if necessary.

               </p>
<ul>
<li>Check to see if patient has transdermal patch or ointment in place before starting IV infusion. The patch (or ointment) is
                     usually removed to prevent overdosage.
                  </li>
<li>Be aware that when switching from IV to transdermal nitroglycerin, the IV infusion rate is reduced by 50% with simultaneous
                     application of 5 or 10 mg/24 h transdermal patch.
                  </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="routemethod">PREPARE:</span> <span class="methodtype">IV Infusion:</span>  IV nitroglycerin is available in differing concentrations. Be attentive to the dilution, dosage, and directions for administration
                  on each vial or ampul. Note that a number of nitroglycerin preparations are available prediluted. Other forms must be diluted
                  in D5W or NS, usually to concentrations between 25500 mcg/mL. Use only glass bottles and manufacturer-supplied IV tubing.
                  Withdraw medication into syringe and inject immediately into the IV solution to minimize contact with plastic. Regular IV
                  tubing can absorb 4080% of nitroglycerin.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Administer IV nitroglycerin with extreme caution to patients with hypotension or hypovolemia since the IV drug may precipitate
            a severe hypotensive state.
         </li>
<li>Monitor patient closely for change in levels of consciousness and for dysrhythmias. IV nitroglycerin solution contains a substantial
            amount of ethanol as diluent. Ethanol intoxication can develop with high doses of IV nitroglycerin (vomiting, lethargy, coma,
            breath smells of alcohol). If intoxication occurs, infusion should be stopped promptly; patient recovers immediately with
            discontinuation of drug administration.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that moisture on sublingual tissue is required for dissolution of sublingual tablet. However, because chest pain
            typically leads to dry mouth, a patient may be unresponsive to sublingual nitroglycerin.
         </li>
<li>Assess for headaches. Approximately 50% of all patients experience mild to severe headaches following nitroglycerin. Transient
            headache usually lasts about 5 min after sublingual administration and seldom longer than 20 min. Assess degree of severity
            and consult as needed with physician about analgesics and dosage adjustment.
         </li>
<li>Supervise ambulation as needed, especially with older adult or debilitated patients. Postural hypotension may occur even with
            small doses of nitroglycerin. Patients may complain of dizziness or weakness due to postural hypotension.
         </li>
<li>Take baseline BP and heart rate with patient in sitting position before initiation of treatment with transdermal preparations.</li>
<li>One hour after transdermal (ointment or unit) medication has been applied, check BP and pulse again with patient in sitting
            position. Report measurements to physician.
         </li>
<li>Assess for and report blurred vision or dry mouth.</li>
<li>Assess for and report the following topical reactions. Contact dermatitis from the transdermal patch; pruritus and erythema
            from the ointment.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that local burning or tingling from the sublingual form has no clinical significance.</li>
<li>Be alert for overdose symptoms: Hypotension, tachycardia; warm, flushed skin becoming cold and cyanotic; headache, palpitations,
            confusion, nausea, vomiting, moderate fever, and paralysis. Tissue hypoxia leads to coma, convulsions, cardiovascular collapse.
            Death can occur from asphyxia.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Store tablet form in its original container.</li>
<li>Sit or lie down upon first indication of oncoming anginal pain.</li>
<li>Spit out the rest of your sublingual tablet as soon as pain is completely relieved, especially if you are experiencing unpleasant
            adverse effects such as headache. Relax for 1520 min after taking tablet to prevent dizziness or faintness.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that pain not relieved by 3 sublingual tablets over a 15-min period may indicate acute MI or severe coronary insufficiency.
            Contact physician immediately or go directly to emergency room.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Sublingual tablets may be taken prophylactically 510 min prior to exercise or other stimulus known to trigger angina
            (drug effect lasts 3060 min).
            						
         </li>
<li>Keep record for physician of number of angina attacks, amount of medication required for relief of each attack, and possible
            precipitating factors.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that contact with water (swimming, bathing) does not affect your transdermal unit.</li>
<li>Remove transdermal unit or ointment immediately from skin and notify physician if faintness, dizziness, or flushing occurs
            following application.
         </li>
<li>You can use a sublingual formulation while transdermal unit or ointment is in place.</li>
<li>Report blurred vision or dry mouth. Both warrant withdrawal of drug.</li>
<li>Change position slowly and avoid prolonged standing. Dizziness, light-headedness, and syncope (due to postural hypotension)
            occur most frequently in older adults.
         </li>
<li>Do not drink alcohol too soon after taking nitroglycerin. It may cause severe postural hypotension (sharp drop in BP), vertigo,
            flushing, or pallor if you drink alcohol too soon after taking nitroglycerin.
         </li>
<li>Report any increase in frequency, duration, or severity of anginal attack.</li>
<li>Withdraw gradually after prolonged use to prevent precipitating anginal attack.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
