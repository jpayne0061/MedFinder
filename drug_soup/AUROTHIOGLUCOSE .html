<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>50 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Mechanism of antiinflammatory action not clearly understood. Gold uptake by macrophages with subsequent inhibition of migration
         and phagocytic action, thereby suppressing immune responsiveness, may be principal mechanism.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Major clinical effect is suppression of joint inflammation in early arthritic disease. Has no effect on reparative process,
         but studies suggest that it may significantly slow or arrest disease progression.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjunctive treatment of both adult and juvenile active rheumatoid arthritis. Generally used when adequate trial with salicylates
         or other <small>NSAID</small>s has not been satisfactory.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis, Felty's syndrome, pemphigus, nondisseminated LE.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Intramuscular</span><br/><ul>
<li>Hold vial horizontally and shake vigorously to ensure uniform suspension. Heating vial to body temperature by placing in a
            warm-water bath facilitates drug withdrawal.
         </li>
<li>Give drug by deep IM injection, preferably intragluteally. Use an 18- or 20-gauge, 1½-inch needle (for obese patients a 2-inch
            needle may be preferable). Patient should be lying down when drug is administered.
         </li>
<li>Have patients remain recumbent for 10 min after injection. Observe patient for 2030 min after injection for hypersensitivity
            reactions.
         </li>
<li>
            				Note: Gold therapy is contraindicated following a severe reaction but may be attempted at reduced initial dosage schedule with careful
            monitoring after a mild reaction.
            			
         </li>
<li>Store at 15°30° C (59°86° F) in light-resistant containers unless otherwise directed. Protect
            from freezing and light.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor therapeutic effectiveness which may not be apparent before 68 wk of gold therapy.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Baseline renal and hepatic function tests, CBC, and urinalysis prior to initiation of therapy. Thereafter, perform
            urinalysis (for protein and sediment) before each injection. Determine CBC (including Hgb, RBC, WBC and differential, platelet
            counts) before every second injection throughout therapy.
         </li>
<li>Withhold drug and notify physician of any of the following: platelet count 3, or leukocytes 3, granulocytes 3, eosinophils &gt;5%, rapid fall in Hgb value, and presence of proteinuria or hematuria.
         </li>
<li>Rule out pregnancy before gold treatment begins. Women of childbearing age should be warned about the potential hazards of
            becoming pregnant during therapy and counseled about the use of birth control.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: During early treatment, some patients complain of exacerbation of joint pain after injection. It usually subsides after the
            first few injections.
            						
         </li>
<li>Monitor S&amp;S of beginning gold toxicity. Toxicity generally involves skin and mucous membranes anywhere in body. Inspect skin
            carefully and examine mouth and throat. Report any of the following promptly: Itching that often precedes dermatitis and eosinophilia,
            bruising or bleeding, tenderness, metallic taste that frequently precedes sore mouth, tongue, or throat, gray-blue discoloration
            of skin and mucous membranes, diarrhea or loose stools, indigestion, unexplained malaise; signs of hepatotoxicity (yellow
            sclerae and skin, clay-colored stools, dark urine, pruritus).
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Rapid improvement in joint pain and mobility also may signify that patient is approaching toxic tissue levels. Interruption
            of therapy, at least temporarily, may be indicated. Notify physician.
            						
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Review with health care provider and understand the list of possible adverse effects that should be reported. If therapy is
            interrupted at the onset of gold toxicity, serious reactions can be avoided.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Adverse reactions are most likely to occur during second and third month of therapy or when cumulative aurothioglucose dose
            is 300500 mg. However, they may appear at any time during therapy or several months after treatment has been discontinued.
            						
         </li>
<li>Report any unusual color or odor to urine, or change in I&amp;O ratio and pattern.</li>
<li>Report unusual fatigue or weakness, malaise, chills, fever, sore throat; possible signs of bleeding (e.g., bleeding gums,
            nosebleeds, dark urine, black stools, petechiae, purpura, easy bruising). Report signs of hepatotoxicity (see Appendix F).
         </li>
<li>Avoid contact with anyone who has a cold, recent vaccination, or has been exposed recently to communicable disease.</li>
<li>Report to physician need to increase the amount of aspirin or other prescribed <small>NSAID</small> for pain as this may indicate diminishing response to gold therapy.
         </li>
<li>Minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light because gray to blue pigmentation may occur on light-exposed
            skin areas.
         </li>
<li>Use careful and thorough oral hygiene. Avoid overuse of mouthwashes, which contain alcohol; these enhance drying and irritation,
            and can change mouth flora.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
