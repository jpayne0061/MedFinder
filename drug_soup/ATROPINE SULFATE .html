<p>0.4 mg tablets; 0.05 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL, 0.3 mg/mL, 0.4 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/mL, 0.8 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Acts by selectively blocking all muscarinic responses to acetylcholine (ACh), whether excitatory or inhibitory. Selective
         depression of CNS relieves rigidity and tremor of Parkinson's syndrome. Antisecretory action (vagolytic effect) suppresses
         sweating, lacrimation, salivation, and secretions from nose, mouth, pharynx, and bronchi. Blocks vagal impulses to heart with
         resulting decrease in AV conduction time, increase in heart rate and cardiac output, and shortened PR interval.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Atropine is a potent bronchodilator when bronchoconstriction has been induced by parasympathomimetics. Produces mydriasis
         (dilation of pupils) and cycloplegia (paralysis of accommodation) by blocking responses of iris sphincter muscle and ciliary
         muscle of lens to cholinergic stimulation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjunct in symptomatic treatment of GI disorders (e.g., peptic ulcer, pylorospasm, GI hypermotility, irritable bowel syndrome)
         and spastic disorders of biliary tract. Relaxes upper GI tract and colon during hypotonic radiography. <i>Ophthalmic Use:</i> To produce mydriasis and cycloplegia before refraction and for treatment of anterior uveitis and iritis. <i>Preoperative Use:</i> To suppress salivation, perspiration, and respiratory tract secretions; to reduce incidence of laryngospasm, reflex bradycardia
         arrhythmia, and hypotension during general anesthesia. <i>Cardiac Uses:</i> For sinus bradycardia or asystole during CPR or that is induced by drugs or toxic substances (e.g., pilocarpine, beta-adrenergic
         blockers, organophosphate pesticides, and <i>Amanita</i> mushroom poisoning); for management of selected patients with symptomatic sinus bradycardia and associated hypotension and
         ventricular irritability; for diagnosis of sinus node dysfunction and in evaluation of coronary artery disease during atrial
         pacing; for management of chronic symptomatic sinus node dysfunction. <i>Other Uses:</i> Oral inhalation for short-term treatment and prevention of bronchospasms associated with asthma, bronchitis, and COPD and
         as drying agent in upper respiratory infection. Adjunctive therapy for hypermotility of GI tract.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor vital signs. HR is a sensitive indicator of patient's response to atropine. Be alert to changes in quality, rate,
            and rhythm of HR and respiration and to changes in BP and temperature.
         </li>
<li>Initial paradoxical bradycardia following IV atropine usually lasts only 12 min; it most likely occurs when IV is administered
            slowly (more than 1 min) or when small doses (less than 0.5 mg) are used. Postural hypotension occurs when patient ambulates
            too soon after parenteral administration.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Frequent and continued use of eye preparations, as well as overdosage, can have systemic effects. Some atropine deaths have
            resulted from systemic absorption following ocular administration in infants and children.
            						
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O, especially in older adults and patients who have had surgery (drug may contribute to urinary retention). Palpate
            lower abdomen for distention. Have patient void before giving atropine.
         </li>
<li>Monitor CNS status. Older adults and debilitated patients sometimes manifest drowsiness or CNS stimulation (excitement, agitation,
            confusion) with usual doses of drug or other belladonna alkaloids. In addition to dosage adjustment, side rails and supervision
            of ambulation may be indicated.
         </li>
<li>Monitor infants, small children, and older adults for "atropine fever" (hyperpyrexia due to suppression of perspiration
            and heat loss), which increases the risk of heatstroke.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Intraocular tension and depth of anterior chamber should be determined before and during therapy with ophthalmic preparations
            to avoid glaucoma attacks (ophthalmic solutions and ointments are available in various strengths).
            						
         </li>
<li>Patients receiving atropine via inhalation sometimes manifest mild CNS stimulation with doses in excess of 5 mg and mental
            depression and other mental disturbances with larger doses.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Follow measures to relieve dry mouth: adequate hydration; small, frequent mouth rinses with tepid water; meticulous mouth
            and dental hygiene; gum chewing or sucking sugarless sourballs.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Drug causes drowsiness, sensitivity to light, blurring of near vision, and temporarily impairs ability to judge distance.
            Avoid driving and other activities requiring visual acuity and mental alertness.
            						
         </li>
<li>Discontinue ophthalmic preparations and notify physician if eye pain, conjunctivitis, palpitation, rapid pulse, or dizziness
            occurs.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
