<p>25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg capsules; 20 mg vial</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Hydantoin derivative, structurally related to phenytoin, with peripheral skeletal muscle relaxant action. Directly relaxes
         the spastic muscle by interfering with calcium ion release from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Clinical doses produce about a 50%
         decrease in contractility of skeletal muscles but no effect on smooth or cardiac muscles.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Relief of spasticity may be accompanied by muscle weakness sufficient to affect overall functional capacity of the patient.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Orally for the symptomatic treatment of skeletal muscle spasms secondary to spinal cord injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, multiple
         sclerosis. Used intravenously for the management of malignant hyperthermia. Oral dantrolene has been used prophylactically
         (2 or 3 d before anesthesia) for patients with a history of malignant hyperthermia or with a family history of the disorder.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, exercise-induced muscle pain, and flexor spasms.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Active hepatic disease; when spasticity is necessary to sustain upright posture and balance in locomotion or to maintain increased
         body function; spasticity due to rheumatic disorders. Safe use during pregnancy (category C), lactation, or in children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Impaired cardiac or pulmonary function, patients &gt;35 y, especially women.</p>

<li>Prepare oral suspension for a single dose, when necessary, by emptying contents of capsule(s) into fruit juice or other liquid.
            Shake suspension well before pouring. Avoid contamination, keep refrigerated, and use within several days, since it will not
            contain a preservative.

<li>Store capsules in tightly closed, light-resistant container. Contents of vial (for IV use) must be protected from direct light
            and used within 6 h after reconstitution, since it does not contain a preservative. Store both PO and parenteral forms at
            15°30° C (59°86° F) unless otherwise directed.

<ul>
<li>Monitor for therapeutic effectiveness. Improvement may not be apparent until 1 wk or more of drug therapy.</li>
<li>Monitor vital signs during IV infusion. Also monitor ECG, CVP, and serum potassium.</li>
<li>Supervise ambulation until patient's reaction to drug is known. Relief of spasticity may be accompanied by some loss of strength.</li>
<li>
            							Note: Most common adverse effects are generally transient, lasting up to 14 d after initiation of therapy. Keep physician informed.
            						
         </li>
<li>Monitor patients with impaired cardiac or pulmonary function closely for cardiovascular or respiratory symptoms such as tachycardia,
            BP changes, feeling of suffocation.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for and report symptoms of allergy and allergic pleural effusion: Shortness of breath, pleuritic pain, dry cough.</li>
<li>Alert physician if improvement is not evident within 45 d. Drug may be discontinued because of the possibility of hepatotoxicity
            (see Appendix F).
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Perform baseline and regularly scheduled hepatic function tests (alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, total bilirubin),
            blood cell counts, and renal function tests.
         </li>
<li>Monitor bowel function. Persistent diarrhea may necessitate drug withdrawal. Severe constipation with abdominal distention
            and signs of intestinal obstruction have been reported.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report promptly the onset of jaundice: yellow skin or sclerae; dark urine, clay-colored stools, itching, abdominal discomfort.
            Hepatotoxicity frequently occurs between 3rd and 12th mo of therapy.
         </li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until response to drug is known.</li>
<li>Do not use OTC medications, alcoholic beverages, or other CNS depressants unless otherwise advised by physician. Liver toxicity
            occurs more commonly when other drugs are taken concurrently.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
