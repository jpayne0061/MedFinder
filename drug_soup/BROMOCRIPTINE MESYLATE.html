<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>2.5 mg tablets; 5 mg capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Semisynthetic ergot alkaloid derivative, but devoid of oxytocic activity generally attributed to drugs of this class. Reduces
         elevated serum prolactin levels in men and women by activating postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors in hypothalamus to stimulate
         release of prolactin-inhibiting factor and possibly luteinizing hormone release factor.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Restores ovulation and ovarian function in amenorrheic women, thus correcting female infertility secondary to elevated prolactin
         levels. Activates dopaminergic receptors in neostriatum of CNS, which may explain action in parkinsonism.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Short-term management of amenorrhea/galactorrhea or female infertility associated with hyperprolactinemia (when there is no
         indication of pituitary tumor). Also used as adjunctive to levodopa or levodopa/carbidopa therapy to relieve symptoms of Parkinson's
         disease and to lower plasma growth hormone in patients with acromegaly.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>To prevent postpartum lactation, to relieve premenstrual symptoms, to treat hypogonadism and galactorrhea in hyperprolactinemic
         men; for management of hepatic encephalopathy, Cushing's syndrome, drug-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and cocaine
         withdrawal.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to ergot alkaloids; uncontrolled hypertension; severe ischemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease;
         pituitary tumor; normal prolactin levels, lactation. Safe use during pregnancy (category C) or in children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Hepatic and renal dysfunction; history of psychiatric disorder; history of MI with residual arrhythmia.</p>

<li>Do not begin therapy unless vital signs are stabilized.</li>
<li>Give with meals, milk, or other food to reduce incidence of GI side effects.</li>
<li>Have patient in supine position before receiving first dose because dizziness and fainting may occur. For this reason, initial
            dose is usually prescribed for evening administration.
         </li>
<li>
            				Note: Withhold therapy until 4 h after delivery and then begin only if vital signs have stabilized.

<li>Monitor vital signs closely during the first few days and periodically throughout therapy.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Periodic CBC, liver functions and renal functions with prolonged therapy.</li>

            							Note: Restoration of regular menses usually occurs in 68 wk. Since fertility may be restored during therapy, advise patients
