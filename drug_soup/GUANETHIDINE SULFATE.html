<p>10 mg, 25 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Potent, long-acting, adrenergic blocking agent. Competes with norepinephrine for reuptake into adrenergic neurons; displaces
         stored norepinephrine, thus exposing it to degradation by MAO. Produces a gradual prolonged fall in BP, usually associated
         with bradycardia and decreased pulse pressure. Drug-induced sodium retention and expansion of plasma volume, with resulting
         tolerance to antihypertensive effect, may occur unless concomitant diuretic therapy is administered.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>It is more effective in lowering orthostatic than supine BP. Antihypertensive effect results from venous dilatation with peripheral
         pooling, decreased venous return, and decreased cardiac output.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Stepped care approach to treatment of moderate to severe hypertension either alone or in conjunction with a thiazide diuretic
         or hydralazine.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Chronic open-angle glaucoma, endocrine ophthalmopathy. <b>Orphan Drug:</b> Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome; causalgia.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Pheochromocytoma, frank CHF (not due to hypertension). Safe use during pregnancy (category C) is not established.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Diabetes mellitus, impaired renal or hepatic function, sinus bradycardia, limited cardiac reserve, coronary disease with insufficiency,
         recent MI, cerebrovascular insufficiency, febrile illnesses, older adults; lactation; history of peptic ulcer, colitis, or
         bronchial asthma.

<ul>
<li>Take BP first in supine position and then again after patient has been standing for 10 min. Ideal dosage reduces standing
            BP to within normal range without faintness, dizziness, weakness, or fatigue.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O, especially in older adults and patients with limited cardiac reserve or impaired renal function. Report changes
            in I&amp;O ratio.
         </li>
<li>Observe for evidence of edema and weight gain. Sudden weight gain of 1 kg (2 lb) in 24 h or more should be reported to physician.
            Patients with limited cardiac reserve are particularly susceptible to guanethidine-induced sodium and water retention, with
            resulting edema, CHF, and drug resistance.
         </li>
<li>Observe patients on antidiabetic therapy closely for signs of hypoglycemia.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not stop drug without consulting physician.</li>
<li>Ask for assistance with walking; older adults are prone to develop orthostatic hypotension.</li>
<li>Understand that orthostatic hypotension is most prominent shortly after arising from sleep and when too rapid changes are
            made to sitting or upright positions. Move gradually to sitting position and make all position changes slowly and in stages.
            Flex arms and legs slowly before standing to augment venous return. Orthostatic hypotension is intensified by prolonged standing,
            hot baths or showers, hot weather, alcohol ingestion, and strenuous physical exercise (particularly if followed by immobility).
         </li>
<li>Lie down or sit down (in head-low position) immediately at the onset of dizziness, weakness, or faintness.</li>
<li>Consult physician regarding allowable salt intake.</li>
<li>Reduced dosage in presence of febrile illnesses. Report fever to physician.</li>
<li>Consult physician or pharmacist before taking any OTC drug; guanethidine may sensitize the patient to some sympathomimetic
            agents found in OTC cold remedies and cause hypertensive crisis.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
