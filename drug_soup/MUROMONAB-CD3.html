<p>5 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Murine monoclonal antibody (purified IgG<sub>2</sub>). Specifically targets the T<sub>3</sub> (CD<sub>3</sub>) molecule in the antigenic recognition site of the human T-cell membrane. Following this antigenic challenge, CD<sub>3</sub>-positive T-cells are rapidly removed from circulation, and T-lymphocyte action leading to renal inflammation and destruction
         is blocked, thus reversing graft rejection. Lymphomas may follow immunosuppression therapy with muromonab-CD<sub>3</sub>; incidence is related to intensity and duration of drug-induced immunosuppression.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>CD<sub>3</sub>-positive T-lymphocytes immunosuppression results in reversing graft rejection of a transplanted kidney.

<ul>
<li>Assess and monitor vital signs. If temperature rises above 37.8° C (100° F), suspect infection (commonly observed
            in first 45 d of therapy). Take temperature before treatment and several hours after drug administration to detect first signs
            of infection.
         </li>
<li>Consult physician if patient has a fever exceeding 37.8° C (100° F) before treatment. Make immediate attempts to
            lower temperature to at least 37.8° C (100° F) with antipyretics before muromonab-CD<sub>3</sub> is administered.
         </li>
<li>Be alert to susceptibility of patient with pretreatment fluid over-load to acute pulmonary edema (may be fatal). Be prepared
            for prompt intubation, oxygenation, and corticosteroid drug administration should it occur.
         </li>
<li>Monitor patient's response closely for 48 h for first dose reaction (occurs within 4560 min after first dose and lasts
            several hours). It may occur (less severe) after second dose; then usually does not occur with subsequent doses. Symptoms:
            Chills, dyspnea, malaise, high fever.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report any of the following to physician: Chest pain, difficulty breathing, wheezing, nausea and vomiting, significant weight
            gain, an infection, or fever.
         </li>
<li>Use an effective method of birth control for 12 wk following the end of therapy.</li>
