<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>10 mg powder for injection; 1 mg/mL vial</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Cell cycle-specific alkaloid, extracted from periwinkle plant <i>Vinca rosea.</i> Arrests mitosis in metaphase by combining with microtubule proteins; may also interfere with other microtubular functions
         such as phagocytosis and cell mobility. Spectrum of activity is not completely established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Interferes with nucleic acid synthesis by arresting proliferating cells in metaphase. Exhibits potent myelosuppressive and
         immunosuppressive properties, but produces less neurotoxicity, in contrast to vincristine.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Palliative treatment of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, choriocarcinoma, lymphosarcoma, neuroblastoma, mycosis
         fungoides, advanced testicular germinal cell cancer, histiocytosis, and other malignancies resistant to other chemotherapy.
         Used singly or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Leukopenia, bacterial infection, pregnancy (category D), lactation, men and women of childbearing potential, older adult patients
         with cachexia or skin ulcers.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Malignant cell infiltration of bone marrow; obstructive jaundice, hepatic impairment; history of gout; use of small amount
         of drug for long periods; use in eyes.

                  drug. Restart infusion in another vein. Observe injection site for sloughing.

<li>Lab tests: Monitor WBC count. Recovery from leukopenic nadir occurs usually within 714 d. With high doses, total leukocyte
            count may not return to normal for 3 wk.
         </li>
<li>Do not administer drug unless WBC count has returned to at least 4000/mm<sup>3</sup>, even if 7 d have passed.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for unexplained bruising or bleeding, which should be promptly reported, even though thrombocyte reduction seldom
            occurs unless patient has had prior treatment with other antineoplastics.
         </li>
<li>Adverse reactions seldom persist beyond 24 h with exception of epilation, leukopenia, and neurologic adverse effects.</li>
<li>Monitor bowel elimination pattern and bowel sounds to recognize severe constipation or paralytic ileus. A stool softener may
            be necessary.
         </li>
<li>Inspect skin surfaces over pressure areas daily if patient is not ambulating. Note condition of skin of older adults especially.</li>
<li>Stop drug if oral tissues break down.</li>

<li>Avoid exposure to infection, injury to skin or mucous membranes, and excessive physical stress, especially during leukocyte
            nadir period.
         </li>
<li>Notify physician promptly about onset of symptoms of agranulocytosis (see Appendix F). Do not delay seeking appropriate treatment.</li>
