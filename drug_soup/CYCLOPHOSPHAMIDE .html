<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Cell-cycle-nonspecific alkylating agent chemically related to the nitrogen mustards. Action mechanism unknown but thought
         to be the result of cross-linkage of DNA strands, thereby blocking synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein. Associated with increased
         risk of secondary malignancies that may be detected several years after cyclophosphamide has been discontinued.
      </p>

<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Total and differential leukocyte count, platelet count, and Hct are determined initially and at least 2 times per
            week during maintenance period. Baseline and periodic determinations of liver and kidney function and serum electrolytes also
            should be made. Microscopic urine examinations are recommended after large IV doses.
         </li>
<li>Thrombocytopenia is rare, but if it occurs (count of 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup> or lower), assess for signs of unexplained bleeding or easy bruising. If platelet count indicates thrombocytopenia (<img src="../images/special/lesserorequal.gif"/>100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>), drug will be discontinued.
         </li>
<li>Marked leukopenia is the most serious side effect. It can be fatal. Nadir may occur in 28 d after first dose but may
            be as late as 1 mo after a series of several daily doses. Leukopenia usually reverses 710 d after therapy is discontinued.
         </li>
<li>During severe leukopenic period, protect patient from infection and trauma and from visitors and medical personnel who have
            colds or other infections.
         </li>
<li>Report onset of unexplained chills, sore throat, tachycardia. Monitor temperature carefully and report an elevation immediately.
            The development of fever in a neutropenic patient (granulocyte count 
         </li><li>Observe and report character of wound drainage. During period of neutropenia, purulent drainage may become serosanguineous
            because there are not enough WBC to create pus. Because of suppressed immune mechanisms, wound healing may be prolonged or
            incomplete.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O ratio and patterns: Since the drug is a chemical irritant, PO and IV fluid intake is generally increased to help
            prevent renal irritation and hemorrhagic cystitis. Have patient void frequently, especially after each dose and just before
            retiring to bed.
         </li>
<li>Watch for symptoms of water intoxication or dilutional hyponatremia; patients are usually well hydrated as part of the therapy.</li>
<li>Promptly report hematuria or dysuria. Drug schedule is usually interrupted and fluids are forced.</li>
<li>Record body weight at least twice weekly (basis for dose determination). Alert physician to sudden change or slow, steady
            weight gain or loss over a period of time that appears inconsistent with caloric intake.
         </li>
<li>Diarrhea may signal onset of hyperkalemia, particularly if accompanied by colicky pain, nausea, bradycardia, and skeletal
            muscle weakness. These symptoms warrant prompt reporting to physician.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for hyperuricemia, which occurs commonly during early treatment period in patients with leukemias or lymphoma. Report
            edema of lower legs and feet; joint, flank, or stomach pain.
         </li>
<li>Protect patient from potential sources of infection. Cyclophosphamide makes the patient particularly susceptible to varicella-zoster
            infections (chickenpox, herpes zoster).
         </li>
<li>Report any sign of overgrowth with opportunistic organisms, especially in patient receiving corticosteroids or who has recently
            been on steroid therapy.
         </li>
<li>Report fever, dyspnea, and nonproductive cough. Pulmonary toxicity is not common, but the already debilitated patient is particularly
            susceptible.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Adhere to dosage regimen and do not omit, increase, decrease, or delay doses. If for any reason drug cannot be taken, notify
            physician.
         </li>
<li>Alopecia occurs in about 33% of patients on cyclophosphamide therapy. Hair loss may be noted 3 wk after therapy begins;
            regrowth (often differs in texture and color) usually starts 56 wk after drug is withdrawn and may occur while on maintenance
            doses.
         </li>
<li>Use adequate means of contraception during and for at least 4 mo after termination of drug treatment. Breast-feeding should
            be discontinued before cyclophosphamide therapy is initiated.
         </li>
<li>Amenorrhea may last up to 1 y after cessation of therapy in 1030% of women.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
