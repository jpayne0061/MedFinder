<ul>
<li>Monitor therapeutic effectiveness which usually requires 68 wk of therapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (improvement
            in morning stiffness and grip strength). If no improvement has occurred after 12-wk trial period, drug is generally discontinued.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Perform CBC, including Hgb and platelet counts, prior to and at least weekly during first month of therapy, twice
            monthly during second and third months, and monthly, or more frequently thereafter, if indicated (e.g., by dosage or therapy
            changes).
         </li>
<li>Monitor for toxicity. Drug has a high toxic potential. Because it may have delayed action, dosage should be reduced or drug
            withdrawn at the first indication of an abnormally large or persistent decrease in leukocyte or platelet count to avoid irreversible
            bone marrow depression.
         </li>
<li>Monitor vital signs. Report signs of infection.</li>
<li>Monitor kidney function (urine protein, urine electrolytes, creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, BUN) periodically.</li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O ratio; note color, character, and specific gravity of urine. Report an abrupt decrease in urinary output or any
            change in I&amp;O ratio.
         </li>
<li>Monitor liver function (alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, serum bilirubin) and repeat at least every 3 mo or more frequently
            if indicated. If hepatic toxicity (see Appendix F) develops, therapy may have to be withdrawn.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for signs of abnormal bleeding [easy bruising, bleeding gums, petechiae, purpura, melena, epistaxis, dark urine (hematuria),
            hemoptysis, hematemesis]. If thrombocytopenia occurs, invasive procedures should be withheld, if possible.
         </li>
<li>Use protective isolation for the hospitalized patient to reduce risk of infections.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid contact with anyone who has a cold or other infection and report signs of impending infection. Exercise scrupulous personal
            hygiene because infection is a constant hazard of immunosuppressive therapy.
         </li>
<li>Practice birth control during therapy and for 4 mo after drug is discontinued. This drug is associated with potential hazards
            in pregnancy.
         </li>
<li>Do not receive/take vaccinations or other immunity-conferring agents during therapy because they may precipitate unusually
            severe reactions due to the immunosuppressive effects of the drug.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
