<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>250 mg, 500 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>A long-acting nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (<small>NSAID</small>) unlike aspirin, in which, inhibition of platelet function and effect on bleeding time are dose related and reversible, lasting
         only about 24 h after drug is discontinued. Is a non-narcotic analgesic agent. Exerts mild antipyretic effect; therefore it
         is not used clinically for this purpose. Has some uricosuric activity at usual dosages.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>This <small>NSAID</small> has peripheral analgesic properties by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. It is more potent than aspirin and acetaminophen
         in equianalgesic doses and has longer duration of effect.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Acute and long-term relief of mild to moderate pain and symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Patients in whom aspirin or other <small>NSAID</small>s precipitate an acute asthmatic attack (bronchospasm), urticaria, angioedema, severe rhinitis, or shock; active peptic ulcer,
         GI bleeding. Safe use during pregnancy (category C), lactation, or children NSAIDs are known to cause premature closure of ductus arteriosus in fetus.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>History of upper GI disease; impaired renal or hepatic function; compromised cardiac function, and other conditions associated
         with fluid retention; patients receiving diuretics; geriatric patients; hypertension; patients who may be adversely affected
         by prolonged bleeding time.

<li>Give with water, milk, or food to reduce GI irritation. Food causes slight reduction in absorption rate, but does not affect
            total amount absorbed.
         </li>
<li>Store at 15°30° C (59°86° F) in tightly closed containers unless otherwise directed.</li>

<ul>
<li>Monitor for therapeutic effectiveness: Full antiinflammatory effect for arthritis may not occur until 8 d to several weeks
            into therapy.
         </li>
<li>Discontinue if patient presents signs of hepatic toxicity (see Appendix F).</li>
<li> 								Note: Although the antipyretic effect is mild, chronic or high doses may mask fever in some patients. 							</li>

<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Swallow tablet whole; do not crush or chew.</li>
<li>Take drug as prescribed. Doubling the dosage can produce greater than doubling of drug accumulation, particularly in patients
            receiving repetitive doses.
         </li>
<li>Report onset of visual or auditory problems immediately to physician.</li>
<li>Be aware of I&amp;O ratio and pattern and check for and report peripheral edema and unusual weight gain.</li>
<li>Report promptly to physician the onset of melena, hematemesis, or severe stomach pain.</li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until reaction to drug is known.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
