<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Broad-spectrum antiinfective that inhibits cell wall synthesis in susceptible strains. Bacteriostatic or bactericidal depending
         on concentration and susceptibility of organism.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> by competitively interfering with the incorporation of <small>D</small>-alanine into the bacterial cell wall.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>In conjunction with other tuberculostatic drugs in treatment of active pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis when primary
         agents isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, streptomycin have failed. Also used in treatment of acute UTI caused by <i>Enterobacter</i> sp. and <i>Escherichia coli</i> that are unresponsive to conventional treatment.
      </p>

<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter to
            detect possible bacterial resistance. Monitor plasma drug levels weekly and hematologic, renal, and hepatic function at regular
            intervals.
         </li>
<li>Maintenance of blood-drug level below 30 mg/mL considerably reduces incidence of neurotoxicity. Possibility of neurotoxicity
            increases when dose is 500 mg or more or when renal clearance is inadequate.
         </li>
<li>Observe patient carefully for signs of hypersensitivity and neurologic effects. Neurotoxicity generally appears within first
            2 wk of therapy and disappears after drug is discontinued.
         </li>
<li>Drug should be withheld and physician notified or dosage reduced if symptoms of CNS toxicity or hypersensitivity reaction
            (see Appendix F) develop.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Take cycloserine after meals to prevent GI irritation.</li>
<li>Notify physician immediately of the onset of skin rash and early signs of CNS toxicity (see Appendix F).</li>
<li>Avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving until reaction to cycloserine has been determined.</li>
<li>Take drug precisely as prescribed and to keep follow-up appointments. Continuous therapy may extend into months or years.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
