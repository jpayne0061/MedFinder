<p>1 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>A heavy metal complex with platinum as central atom surrounded by 2 chloride atoms and 2 ammonia molecules in the cis chemical
         position. Biochemical properties similar to those of bifunctional alkylating agents. Produces interstrand and intrastrand
         cross linkage in DNA of rapidly dividing cells, thus preventing DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Cell cycle-nonspecific, i.e., effective throughout the entire cell life cycle. Carcinogenicity has not been fully studied,
         but other compounds with similar action mechanisms and mutogenicity have been studied.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Established combination therapy (cisplatin, vinblastine, bleomycin) in patient with metastatic testicular tumors and with
         doxorubicin for metastatic ovarian tumors following appropriate surgical or radiation therapy.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Carcinoma of endometrium, bladder, head, and neck.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>History of hypersensitivity to cisplatin or other platinum-containing compounds; impaired renal function; myelosuppression;
         impaired hearing; history of gout and urate renal stones; hypomagnesia; concurrent administration with loop diuretics; Raynard
         syndrome; pregnancy (category D), lactation. Safe use in children not established, although experimental regimens have been
         used.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Previous cytotoxic drug or radiation therapy with other ototoxic and nephrotoxic drugs; hyperuricemia. Electrolyte imbalances,
         hepatic impairment; history of circulatory disorders.

<ul>
<li>Administered only under supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of antineoplastics.</li>
<li>Usually a parenteral antiemetic agent is administered ½ h before cisplatin therapy is instituted and given on a scheduled
            basis throughout day and night as long as necessary.
         </li>
<li>Before the initial dose is given, hydration is started with 12 L IV infusion fluid to reduce risk of nephrotoxicity
            and ototoxicity.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain baseline ECG and cardiac monitoring during induction therapy because of possible myocarditis or focal irritability.</li>
<li>Lab tests: The following tests should be done <i>before</i> initiating every course of therapy and repeated each week during treatment period: serum uric acid, serum creatinine, BUN,
            urinary creatinine clearance. CBC and platelet counts are done weekly for 2 wk after each course of treatment. Monitor periodically
            serum electrolytes and liver function tests.
         </li>
<li>A repeat course of therapy should not be given until (1) serum creatinine is below 1.5 mg/dL; (2) BUN is below 25 mg/dL; (3)
            platelets <img src="../images/special/greaterorequal.gif"/>100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; (4) WBC<sup></sup> <img src="../images/special/greaterorequal.gif"/>4000/mm<sup>3</sup>; (5) audiometric test is within normal limits.
         </li>
<li>Monitor urine output and specific gravity for 4 consecutive hours before treatment and for 24 h after therapy. Report if output
            is less than 100 mL/h or if specific gravity is more than 1.030. A urine output of less than 75 mL/h necessitates medical
            intervention to avert a renal emergency.
         </li>
<li>Audiometric testing should be performed before the first dose and before each subsequent dose. Ototoxicity (reported in 31%
            of patients) may occur after a single dose of 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. Children who receive repeated doses are especially susceptible.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for anaphylactoid reactions (particularly in patient previously exposed to cisplatin), which may occur within minutes
            of drug administration.
         </li>
<li>Monitor closely for dose-related adverse reactions. Drug action is cumulative; therefore severity of most adverse effects
            increases with repeated doses.
         </li>
<li>Nephrotoxicity (reported in 2836% of patients receiving a single dose of 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) usually occurs within 2 wk after drug administration and becomes more severe and prolonged with repeated courses of cisplatin.
         </li>
<li>Suspect ototoxicity if patient manifests tinnitus or difficulty hearing in the high frequency range.</li>
<li>Intractable nausea and vomiting severe enough to warrant discontinuation of drug usually begin 14 h after treatment
            and may last 24 h or persist for up to 1 wk after treatment is ended.
         </li>
<li>Monitor and report abnormal electrolyte levels: sodium &gt;145 or 5 or 
         </li><li>Monitor results of blood studies. The nadirs in platelet and leukocyte counts occur between day 18 and 23 (range: 7.545)
            with most patients recovering in 1362 d. A decrease in Hgb (more than 2 g/dL) occurs at approximately the same time
            and with the same frequency.
         </li>
<li>Check BP, mental status, pupils, and fundi every hour during therapy. Hydration and mannitol may increase the danger of elevated
            intracranial pressure (ICP).
         </li>
<li>Neurologic examinations at regular intervals should include tests of muscle strength, Romberg, vibratory and position sense,
            tests of sensation.
         </li>
<li>Monitor and report abnormal bowel elimination pattern. Constipation and the possibility of fecal impaction may be caused by
            neurotoxicity; diarrhea is a possible response to GI irritation.
         </li>
<li>Inspect oral membranes for xerostomia (white patches and ulcerations) and tongue for signs of fungal overgrowth (black, furry
            appearance).
         </li>
<li>Institute infection precautions promptly if a temperature increase of 0.6° F over the previous reading is noted.</li>
<li>Weigh the patient under standard conditions every day. A gradual ascending weight profile occurring over a period of several
            days should be reported.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Continue maintenance of adequate hydration (at least 3000 mL/24 h oral fluid if physician agrees) and report promptly: reduced
            urinary output, flank pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dry mucosae, itching skin, urine odor on breath, fluid retention,
            and weight gain.
         </li>
<li>Avoid rapid changes in position to minimize risk of dizziness or falling.</li>
<li>Tingling, numbness, and tremors of extremities, loss of position sense and taste, and constipation are early signs of neurotoxicity.
            Report their occurrence promptly to prevent irreversibility. Pain with heel walking and difficulty in getting out of bed or
            chair are late indicators of nerve damage.
         </li>
<li>Report tinnitus or any hearing impairment.</li>
<li>Report promptly evidence of unexplained bleeding and easy bruising.</li>
<li>Report unusual fatigue, fever, sore mouth and throat, abnormal body discharges.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
