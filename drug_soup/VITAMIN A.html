<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Essential for normal growth and development of bones and teeth, for integrity of epithelial and mucosal surfaces, and for
         synthesis of visual purple necessary for visual adaptation to the dark. Synthetic fat-soluble vitamin available for clinical
         use as retinol or retinol esters. Formulation includes vitamin A as well as its precursors.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Replacement therapy using Aquasol A. Used also to stimulate healing of cortisone-retarded wounds when applied topically.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Vitamin A deficiency and as dietary supplement during periods of increased requirements, such as pregnancy, lactation, infancy,
         and infections. Used as replacement therapy in conditions that affect absorption, mobilization, or storage of vitamin A (e.g.,
         steatorrhea, severe biliary obstruction, liver cirrhosis, total gastrectomy). Used in skin disorders [e.g., folliculosis keratosis
         (Darier's disease), psoriasis]; however, other retinoids are being preferentially selected. Also used as a screening test
         for fat malabsorption.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>History of sensitivity to vitamin A or to any ingredient in formulation, hypervitaminosis A, oral administration to patients
         with malabsorption syndrome. Safe use in amounts exceeding 6000 IU during pregnancy [category A (category X if &gt;RDA)] is not
         established.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate dosage with consideration of patient's average daily intake of vitamin A. Take dietary and drug history (e.g., intake
            of fortified foods, dietary supplements, self-administration or prescription drug sources). Women taking oral contraceptives
            tend to have significantly high plasma vitamin A levels.
         </li>
<li>Monitor therapeutic effectiveness. Vitamin A deficiency is often associated with protein malnutrition as well as other vitamin
            deficiencies. It may manifest as night blindness, restriction of growth and development, epithelial alterations, susceptibility
            to infection, abnormal dryness of skin, mouth, and eyes (xerophthalmia) progressing to keratomalacia (ulceration and necrosis
            of cornea and conjunctiva), and urinary tract calculi.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid use of mineral oil while on vitamin A therapy.</li>
<li>Notify physician of symptoms of overdosage (e.g., nausea, vomiting, anorexia, drying and cracking of skin or lips, headache,
            loss of hair).
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug in high doses without consulting physician.</li>
