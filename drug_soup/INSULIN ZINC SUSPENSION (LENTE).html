<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Intermediate-acting, cloudy insulin suspension, equivalent to a mixture of 30% prompt insulin zinc (Semilente) and 70%
         extended zinc insulin (Ultralente) suspensions. Obtained from pork pancreas. Allergic reactions are rare. Time action is intermediate
         between those of prompt and extended insulins and is so close to that of isophane (NPH) insulin that the two forms may be
         used interchangeably.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>It lowers blood glucose levels by increasing peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat tissue, and
         by inhibiting the liver from changing glycogen to glucose.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Hyperglycemia in diabetic patients allergic to other preparations of insulin. Also for patients with evidence of thrombotic
         phenomena in which protamine may be a factor.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>During episodes of hypoglycemia or in patients sensitive to any ingredient in the formulation.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>In insulin resistant patients, hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism; lactation, older adults, pregnancy (category B), renal or
         hepatic impairment. Safety and efficacy in children

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Subcutaneous/</span><span class="adminroutetype">Intramuscular</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give insulin zinc suspensions 30 min before breakfast. Some patients require another injection 30 min before supper time or
            at bedtime.
         </li>
<li>
            				Note: Zinc insulin preparations (Ultralente, Lente, Semilente) can be mixed with one another if prescribed by physician, but they
            must <small>NOT</small> be mixed with other modified insulins. Compatible with regular insulin.
            			
         </li>
<li>Ensure complete dispersion by mixing thoroughly by gently rotating the vial between the palms and by inverting it end-to-end
            several times. Do not shake.
         </li>
<li>
            				Note: Time of action of insulin zinc suspension (Lente) approximates that of isophane insulin suspension (NPH) allowing patients
            usually to be transferred directly to the latter on a unit-for-unit basis.
            			
         </li>
<li>Store unopened vial at 2°8° C (36°46° F). Avoid freezing and exposure to extremes in temperature
            or to direct sunlight.
         </li>

<ul>
<li>Be alert for S&amp;S of hypoglycemia (see Appendix F); most apt to occur between mid-afternoon and dinner time (an early symptom
            may be a sense of extreme fatigue). Immediately take soluble carbohydrate (e.g., orange juice, honey). If the time between
            the midday and evening meal is prolonged, an afternoon snack may be needed.
         </li>
<li>Do not overlook possibility of nocturnal hypoglycemia, especially during dose adjustment. Signs include restlessness or profuse
            sweating during sleep.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
