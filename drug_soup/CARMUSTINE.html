         			Note: When administering IV to infants and children, verify correct IV concentration and rate of infusion with physician.

<tr>
<td><span class="ivtitle">Intravenous</span><p><span class="routemethod">PREPARE:</span> <span class="methodtype"> IV Infusion:</span>  Wear disposable gloves; contact of drug with skin can cause burning, dermatitis, and hyperpigmentation. Add supplied diluent
                  to the 100 mg vial. Further dilute with 27 mL of sterile water for injection to yield a concentration of 3.3 mg/mL. Each dose
                  is then added to 100500 mL of D5W or NS. If possible avoid using PVC IV tubing and bags.  
               </p>
<p><span class="routemethod">ADMINISTER:</span> <span class="methodtype"> IV Infusion:</span>  Infuse a single dose over at least 1 h. Slow infusion over 12 h and adequate dilution will reduce pain of administration.
                  Avoid starting infusion into dorsum of hand, wrist, or the antecubital veins; extravasation in these areas can damage underlying
                  tendons and nerves leading to loss of mobility of entire limb.

<ul>
<li>Monitor for nausea and vomiting (dose related), which may occur within 2 h after drug administration and persist for up to
            6 h. Prior administration of an antiemetic may help to decrease or prevent these adverse effects.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Baseline CBC with differential and platelet count, repeat blood studies following infusion at weekly intervals
            for at least 6 wk. Baseline and periodic tests of hepatic and renal function.
         </li>
<li>Platelet nadir usually occurs within 45 wk, and leukocyte nadir within 56 wk after therapy is terminated. Thrombocytopenia
            may be more severe than leukopenia; anemia is less severe.
         </li>
<li>Check temperature daily. Avoid use of rectal thermometer to prevent injury to mucosa. An elevation of 0.6° F or more
            above usual temperature warrants reporting.
         </li>
<li>Report symptoms of lung toxicity (cough, shortness of breath, fever) to the physician immediately.</li>
<li>Be alert to signs of hepatic toxicity (jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, light-colored stools) and renal insufficiency (dysuria,
            oliguria, hematuria, swelling of lower legs and feet).
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report burning sensation immediately, as carmustine can cause burning discomfort even in the absence of extravasation. Infusion
            will be discontinued and restarted in another site. Ice application over the area may decrease the discomfort.
         </li>
<li>Intense flushing of skin may occur during IV infusion. This usually disappears in 24 h.</li>
<li>You will be highly susceptible to infection and to hemorrhagic disorders. Be alert to hazardous periods that occur 46
            wk after a dose of carmustine. If possible, avoid invasive procedures (e.g., IM injections, enemas, rectal temperatures) during
            this period.
         </li>
<li>Report promptly the onset of sore throat, weakness, fever, chills, infection of any kind, or abnormal bleeding (ecchymosis,
            petechiae, epistaxis, bleeding gums, hematemesis, melena).
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
