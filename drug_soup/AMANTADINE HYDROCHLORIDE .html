<p>100 mg capsules; 50 mg/5 mL syrup</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Because it does not suppress antibody formation, it can be administered for interim protection in combination with influenza
         A virus vaccine until antibody titer is adequate or to augment prophylaxis in a previously vaccinated individual. Mechanism
         of action in parkinsonism not understood, but may be related to release of dopamine and other catecholamines from neuronal
         storage sites.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Active against several strains of influenza A virus; not effective against influenza B infections. Also provides anticholinergic
         effects.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>In initial therapy or as adjunct with anticholinergic drugs or levodopa in treatment of all forms of parkinsonism (arteriosclerotic,
         idiopathic, postencephalitic) and for relief of drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions and symptomatic parkinsonism caused
         by carbon monoxide poisoning. Also used for prophylaxis and symptomatic treatment of influenza A infections.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Primary enuresis, pseudosclerosis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), management of cocaine dependency and withdrawal.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Safety during pregnancy (category C), lactation, and in children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>History of epilepsy or other types of seizures; CHF, peripheral edema, orthostatic hypotension; recurrent eczematoid dermatitis;
         psychoses, severe psychoneuroses; hepatic disease; renal impairment; older adults with cerebral arteriosclerosis.

<li>Influenza prophylaxis: Drug should be initiated when exposure is anticipated and continued for at least 10 d.</li>
<li>
            				Note: Used in conjunction with influenza A vaccine (generally in high-risk patients who have not been vaccinated previously) until
            protective antibodies develop (1021 d) after vaccine administration.
            			
         </li>
<li>Schedule medication in the morning or, with q12h dosing, schedule 2nd dose several hours before bedtime. If insomnia is a
            problem, suggest patient limit number of daytime naps.
         </li>
<li>Store in tightly closed container preferably at 15°30° C (59°86° F) unless otherwise directed

<ul>
<li>Monitor effectiveness. Note that with parkinsonism, maximum response occurs within 2 wk3 mo. Effectiveness may wane
            after 68 wk of treatment; report change to physician.
         </li>
<li>Monitor and report: Mental status changes; nervousness, difficulty concentrating, or insomnia; loss of seizure control; S&amp;S
            of toxicity, especially with doses above 200 mg/d.
         </li>
<li>Establish a baseline profile of the patient's disabilities to accurately differentiate disease symptoms and drug-induced neuropsychiatric
            adverse reactions.
         </li>
<li>Monitor vital signs for at least 3 or 4 d after increases in dosage; also monitor urinary output.</li>
<li>Lab tests: pH and serum electrolytes.</li>
<li>Monitor for and report reduced salivation, increased akinesia or rigidity, and psychological disturbances that may develop
            within 448 h after initiation of therapy and after dosage increases with parkinsonism.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
            							Note: For influenza take within 24 h but no later than 48 h after onset of symptoms for effective response and continue for 2448
            h after symptoms disappear; contact physician if no improvement within this time.
            						
         </li>
<li>Make all position changes slowly, particularly from recumbent to upright position, in order to minimize dizziness.</li>
<li>Report any of the following to physician: Shortness of breath, peripheral edema, significant weight gain, dizziness or lightheadedness,
            inability to concentrate, and other changes in mental status, difficulty urinating, and visual impairment.
         </li>
<li>Do not drive and exercise caution with potentially hazardous activities until response to the drug is known.</li>
<li>
            							Note: People with Parkinson's disease should not discontinue therapy abruptly; doing so may precipitate a parkinsonian crisis with
            severe akinesia, rigidity, tremor, and psychic disturbances. Adhere to established dosage regimen.
            						
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
