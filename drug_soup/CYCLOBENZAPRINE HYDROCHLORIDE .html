<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>5 mg, 10 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Structurally and pharmacologically related to tricyclic antidepressants. Relieves skeletal muscle spasm of local origin without
         interfering with muscle function. Believed to act primarily within CNS at brain stem; some action at spinal cord level is
         also probable. Depresses tonic somatic motor activity, although both gamma and alpha motor neurons are affected.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>In common with other tricyclic compounds, it increases circulating norepinephrine by blocking its synaptic reuptake, thus
         producing its antidepressant effect. Also has sedative effects and potent central and peripheral anticholinergic activity.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Short-term adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute musculoskeletal conditions.
         Not effective in treatment of spasticity associated with cerebral palsy or cerebral or cord disease.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Acute recovery phase of MI, patients with cardiac arrhythmias, heart block or conduction disturbances, CHF, hyperthyroidism.
         Use for periods longer than 2 or 3 wk not recommended by manufacturer. Pregnancy (category B), lactation. Safe use in children
         
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Patients receiving anticholinergic medications; prostatic hypertrophy, history of urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma;
         increased IOP, seizures; cardiovascular disease; hepatic impairment; older adults, debilitated patients; history of psychiatric
         illness.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Supervision of ambulation may be indicated, especially in the older adult because of risk of drowsiness and dizziness.</li>
<li>Withhold drug and notify physician if signs of hypersensitivity, e.g., pruritus, urticaria, rash, appear.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid driving and other potentially hazardous activities until reaction to drug is known. Adverse effects include drowsiness
            and dizziness.
         </li>
<li>Avoid alcohol and other <small>CNS DEPRESSANTS</small> (unless otherwise directed by physician) because cyclobenzaprine enhances their effects.
         </li>
<li>Dry mouth may be relieved by increasing total fluid intake (if not contraindicated).</li>
<li>Keep physician informed of therapeutic effectiveness. Spasmolytic effect usually begins within 1 or 2 d and may be manifested
            by lessening of pain and tenderness, increase in range of motion, and ability to perform ADL.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
