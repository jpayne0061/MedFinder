<p>50 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Oral nonsteroidal estrogen agonist or antagonist. Induces ovulation in selected anovulatory women. Lacks androgenic, antiandrogenic,
         or progestational effects and does not appear to effect pituitary-adrenal or pituitary-thyroid functions. May act by binding
         to hypothalamic estrogen receptors, decreasing their numbers, and by inhibiting receptor replenishment.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Inhibition of receptor replenishment results in a false hypoestrogenic state which stimulates pituitary release of luteinizing
         hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and gonadotropins, leading to ovarian stimulation. Normal ovulatory function
         does not usually resume after treatment or after pregnancy.

<ul>
<li>Monitor for abnormal bleeding. If it occurs, full diagnostic measures are crucial. Report it immediately.</li>
<li>Monitor for visual disturbances. Their occurrence indicates the need for a complete ophthalmologic evaluation. Drug will be
            stopped until symptoms subside.
         </li>
<li>If clomiphene is continued more than 1 y, patient should have an ophthalmologic examination at regular intervals.</li>
<li>Pelvic pain indicates the need for immediate pelvic examination for diagnostic purposes.</li>
