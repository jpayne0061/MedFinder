<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>1%, 0.2%, 0.3% injection; 20 mg powder; 2% solution; 1%, 2% cream; 2% gel; 1% ointment; 0.5% ophthalmic solution</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Local anesthetic that depresses the initial depolarization phase of the action potential, thus preventing propagation and
         conduction of the nerve impulse. Local anesthetic approximately 10 times more potent and toxic than procaine.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Indicated by loss of sensation and motor activity in circumscribed body areas close to injection or application site.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Spinal anesthesia (high, low, saddle block) and topically to produce surface anesthesia. <b>Eye:</b> To anesthetize conjunctiva and cornea prior to superficial procedures (including tonometry, gonioscopy, removal of foreign
         bodies or sutures, corneal scraping). <b>Nose and Throat:</b> To abolish laryngeal and esophageal reflexes prior to bronchoscopy, esophagoscopy. <b>Skin:</b> To relieve pruritus, pain, burning.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Older adult and debilitated patients; prolonged use of ophthalmic preparations; known hypersensitivity to tetracaine or other
         local anesthetics of ester type (e.g., procaine, chloroprocaine, cocaine) or to PABA or its derivatives; infection at application
         or injection site.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Shock; cachexia, cardiac decompensation; lactation. Safety during pregnancy (category C) or in children is not established.</p>

<li>Avoid use of solutions that are cloudy, discolored, or crystallized.</li>
<li>When tetracaine is used on mucosa of larynx, trachea, or esophagus, the manufacturer recommends adding 0.06 mL of a 0.1%
            epinephrine solution to each mL tetracaine solution to slow absorption of the anesthetic.
         </li>
<li>Store ophthalmic solution and ointment at 15°30° C (59°86° F); refrigerate topical. Avoid
            freezing. Use tight, light-resistant containers.

<ul>
<li>Recovery from anesthesia to the pharyngeal area is complete when patient has feeling in the hard and soft palates and when
            muscles in the faucial (tonsillar) pillars contract with stimulation.
         </li>
<li>Do not give food or liquids until these normal pharyngeal responses are present (usually about 1 h after anesthetic administration).
            The first small amount of liquid (water) should be given under supervision of care provider.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that increased blood concentration of the drug may result from excess application of tetracaine to the skin (to relieve
            pruritus or burning), application to debrided or infected skin surfaces, or too rapid injection rate.
         </li>
<li>High blood concentrations of tetracaine can lead to adverse systemic effects involving CNS and CV systems: Convulsions, respiratory
            arrest, dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use ophthalmic drug longer than prescribed period. Prolonged use to eye surface may cause corneal epithelial erosions
            and retard healing of corneal surface.
         </li>
<li>Natural barriers to eye infection and injury are removed by the anesthesia. Do not rub eye after drug instillation until anesthetic
            effect has dissipated (evidenced by return of blink reflex). Patching for temporary protection of the corneal epithelium may
            be ordered.
         </li>
<li>Wash or disinfect hands before and after self-administration of solutions or ointment.</li>
