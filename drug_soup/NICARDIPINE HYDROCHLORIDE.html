<p>20 mg, 30 mg capsules; 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg sustained release capsules; 2.5 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Calcium entry blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle, thus affecting
         contractility. More selectively affects vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle; relaxes coronary vascular smooth muscle
         with little or no negative inotropic effect.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Significantly decreases systemic vascular resistance. It reduces BP at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercise.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Either alone or with beta blockers for chronic, stable (effort-associated) angina; either alone or with other antihypertensives
         for essential hypertension.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>CHF, cerebral ischemia, migraine.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to nicardipine; advanced aortic stenosis; lactation.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Establish baseline data before treatment is started including BP, pulse, and lab values of liver and kidney function.</li>
<li>Monitor BP during initiation and titration of dosage carefully. Hypotension with or without an increase in heart rate may
            occur, especially in patients who are hypertensive or who are already taking antihypertensive medication.
         </li>
<li>Avoid too rapid reduction in either systolic or diastolic pressure during parenteral administration.</li>
<li>Discontinue IV infusion if hypotension or tachycardia develop.</li>
<li>Observe for large peak and trough differences in BP. Initially, measure BP at peak effect (12 h after dosing) and at
            trough effect (8 h after dosing).
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Record and report any increase in frequency, duration, and severity of angina when initiating or increasing dosage. Keep a
            record of nitroglycerin use and promptly report any changes in previous anginal pattern. Increased incidence and severity
            of angina has occurred in some patients using nicardipine.
         </li>
<li>Do not change dosage regimen without consulting physician.</li>
<li>Be aware that abrupt withdrawal may cause an increased frequency and duration of chest pain. This drug must be gradually tapered
            under medical supervision.
         </li>
<li>Rise slowly from a recumbent position; avoid driving or operating potentially dangerous equipment until response to nicardipine
            is known.
         </li>
<li>Notify physician if any of the following occur: Irregular heart beat, shortness of breath, swelling of the feet, pronounced
            dizziness, nausea, or drop in BP.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
