<p>38 mg, 40 mg vial</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Purified fragments of antibodies specific for digoxin (but also effective for digitoxin) produced in sheep immunized with
         digoxinalbumin conjugate. Use of fragments of antidigoxin antibodies (Fab) instead of whole antibody molecules permits
         more extensive and faster distribution to serum and toxic cellular sites.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>FAB acts by selectively complexing with circulating digoxin or digitoxin, thereby preventing drug from binding at receptor
         sites; the complex is then eliminated in urine.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Treatment of potentially life-threatening digoxin or digitoxin intoxication in carefully selected patients.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to sheep products; renal or cardiac failure. Safe use during pregnancy (category C) or lactation is not established.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Prior treatment with sheep antibodies or ovine Fab fragments; history of allergies; impaired renal function.</p>

<h1><a name="adverse">Adverse Effects (<img src="../images/special/greaterorequal.gif"/>1%)</a></h1> Adverse reactions associated with use of digoxin immune Fab are related primarily to the effects of <b>digitalis</b> withdrawal on the heart (see Nursing Implications).

<ul>
<li>Perform skin testing for allergy prior to administration of immune Fab, particularly in patients with history of allergy or
            who have had previous therapy with immune Fab.
         </li>
<li>Keep emergency equipment and drugs immediately available before skin testing is done or first dose is given and until patient
            is out of danger.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for therapeutic effectiveness: Reflected in improvement in cardiac rhythm abnormalities, mental orientation and other
            neurologic symptoms, and GI and visual disturbances. S&amp;S of reversal of digitalis toxicity occurs in 1560 min in adults
            and usually within minutes in children.
         </li>
<li>Baseline and frequent vital signs and EGG during administration.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Baseline and periodic serum potassium and serum digoxin; serum digoxin or digitoxin concentration (this measurement
            will not be accurate for at least 57 d after therapy begins because of test interference by immune Fab).
         </li>
<li> 								Note: Serum potassium is particularly critical during first several hours following administration of immune Fab. Monitor closely. 							</li>
<li>Monitor closely: Cardiac status may deteriorate as inotropic action of digitalis is withdrawn by action of immune Fab. CHF,
            arrhythmias, increase in heart rate, and hypokalemia can occur.
         </li>
<li>Make sure serum digoxin levels and ECG readings are obtained for at least 23 wk.</li>
