<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1>
<p>
         			Note: Caregiver needs to wear plastic disposable or rubber gloves when applying lindane, especially if pregnant or applying medication
         to more than one patient, to avoid prolonged skin contact.
         		
      </p><span class="adminroutetype">Topical</span><br/><ul>
<li>Remove all skin lotions, creams, and oil-based hair dressings completely and allow skin to dry and cool before applying lindane;
            this will reduce percutaneous absorption.
         </li>
<li>Shake cream or lotion container well. <i>Scabies:</i> Apply thin film from neck down over entire body surface including soles of feet. Avoid face and urethral meatus. Pay particular
            attention to intertriginous areas (finger webs and other body creases and folds), wrists, elbows, and belt line. Rub drug
            in; allow skin to dry and cool after application. After 812 h, remove medication by bath or shower. <i>Crab lice:</i> Apply thin film of drug to hair and skin of pubic area and, if infected, to thighs, trunk, axillary areas. Leave in place
            812 h and follow with bath or shower. Observation of living lice after 7 d indicates the need for reapplication.
         </li>
<li>Shampoo <i>(head lice):</i> Apply sufficient quantity to wet hair and skin. Work drug thoroughly onto hair shafts and scalp and allow to remain in place
            4 min. Add small amounts of water sufficient to make a thick lather; then rinse well with water. Pay particular attention
            to areas above and behind ears and occipital region. Use fine-tooth comb or tweezers to remove remaining nit shells. If necessary,
            treatment may be repeated after 7 d but not more than twice in 1 wk. <i>Crab lice:</i> See above. Repeat treatment after 7 d only if live lice can be demonstrated.
         </li>
<li>Store in tight container away from direct light and heat. Protect from freezing.</li>

<ul>
<li>Suspect scabies if a person complains of nocturnal itching (classic symptom). Infestation sources: sex partner, other family
            members, people and animals in close contact.
         </li>
<li>Identify and treat the sex partner simultaneously because both scabies and <i>P. pubis</i> infestation are sexually transmitted diseases.
         </li>
<li>Burrows made by scabies mites (may or may not be visible) appear as grayish black straight or S-shaped lines with a papule
            containing the mite at one end and surrounded by a mild erythematous area.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lindane is highly toxic drug if topical applications are excessive or if swallowed or inhaled. Keep out of reach of children.</li>
<li>
            							Note: Lindane shampoo is an effective disinfectant for personal items such as combs, brushes.
            						
         </li>
<li>Skin penetration with scabies mites causes an intolerable itching that may persist 23 wk after they have been killed.</li>
<li>Discontinue medication and notify physician if skin eruptions appear.</li>
<li>Do not apply medication to face, mouth, open skin lesions, or to eyelashes; avoid contact with eyes. If accidental eye contact
            occurs, flush with water.
         </li>
<li>Recurring limited infestations of scabies may indicate a domestic animal source (e.g., cat, dog, cattle, poultry).</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
