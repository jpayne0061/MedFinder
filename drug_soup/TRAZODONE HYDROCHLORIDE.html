<ul>
<li>Monitor pulse rate and regularity before administration if patient has preexisting cardiac disease.</li>
<li> 							Note: Adverse effects generally are mild and tend to decrease and disappear after the first few weeks of treatment. 						</li>
<li>Observe patient's level of activity. If it appears to be increasing toward sleeplessness and agitation with changes in reality
            orientation, report to physician. Manic episodes have been reported.
         </li>
<li>Check patient for symptoms of hypotension. If orthostatic hypotension is troublesome, suggest measures to reduce danger of
            falling and help patient to tolerate the effects. Discuss with physician; reduction of dose or discontinuation of the drug
            may be prescribed.
         </li>
<li>Male patient should report inappropriate or prolonged penile erections. The drug may be discontinued.</li>
<li>Be aware that overdose is characterized by an extension of common adverse effects: Vomiting, lethargy, drowsiness, and exaggerated
            anticholinergic effects. Seizures or arrhythmias are unusual.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Expect therapeutic response to begin in 1 wk; may require 24 wk to reach maximum levels. Adhere to regimen.</li>
<li>Do not alter dose or intervals between doses.</li>
<li>Consult physician if drowsiness becomes a distressing adverse effect. Dose regimen may be changed so that largest dose is
            at bedtime.
         </li>
<li>Limit or abstain from alcohol use. The depressant effects of CNS depressants and alcohol may be potentiated by this drug.</li>
<li>Do not self-medicate with OTC drugs for colds, allergy, or insomnia treatment without advice of physician. Many of these drugs
            contain CNS depressants.
         </li>
<li>Keep follow-up appointments to permit dose adjustment or discontinuation, as indicated.</li>
<li>Alert dentist, surgeon, or emergency personnel that drug is being used. Trazodone is discontinued as long as possible prior

         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
