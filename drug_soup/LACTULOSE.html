<p>10 g/15 mL solution, syrup</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Reduces blood ammonia; appears to involve metabolism of lactose to organic acids by resident intestinal bacteria.</p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Acidifies colon contents, which retards diffusion of nonionic ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) from colon to blood while promoting its migration from blood to colon. In the acidic colon, NH<sub>3</sub> is converted to nonabsorbable ammonium ions (NH<sub>4</sub>) and is then expelled in feces by laxative action. Decreased blood ammonia in a patient with hepatic encephalopathy is marked
         by improved EEG patterns and mental state (clearing of confusion, apathy, and irritation). Osmotic effect of organic acids
         causes laxative action, which moves water from plasma to intestines, softens stools, and stimulates peristalsis by pressure
         from water content of stool.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE), including stages of hepatic precoma and coma, and by prescription
         for relief of chronic constipation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>to restore regular bowel habit posthemorrhoidectomy; to evacuate bowel in older adult patients with severe constipation after
         barium studies; and for treatment of chronic constipation in children.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Low galactose diet; pregnancy (category C). Safe use in lactation or children is not established.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Diabetes mellitus; concomitant use with electrocautery procedures (proctoscopy, colonoscopy); older adult and debilitated
         patients; pediatric use.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give with fruit juice, water, or milk (if not contraindicated) to increase palatability. Laxative effect is enhanced by taking
            with ample liquids. Avoid meal times.
         </li>
</ul><span class="adminroutetype">Rectal</span><br/><ul>
<li>Administer as a retention enema via a rectal balloon catheter. If solution is evacuated too soon, instillation may be promptly
            repeated.
         </li>
<li>Do not freeze. Avoid prolonged exposure to temperatures above 30° C (86° F) or to direct light. Normal darkening
            does not affect action, but discard solution that is very dark or cloudy.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>In children if the initial dose causes diarrhea, dosage is reduced immediately. Discontinue if diarrhea persists.</li>
<li>Promote fluid intake (<img src="../images/special/greaterorequal.gif"/>15002000 mL/d) during drug therapy for constipation;
            older adults often self-limit liquids. Lactulose-induced osmotic changes in the bowel support intestinal water loss and potential
            hypernatremia. Discuss strategy with physician.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Laxative action is not instituted until drug reaches the colon; therefore, about 2448 h is needed.</li>
<li>Do not self-medicate with another laxative due to slow onset of drug action.</li>
<li>Notify physician if diarrhea (i.e., more than 2 or 3 soft stools/d) persists more than 2448 h. Diarrhea is a sign of
            overdosage. Dose adjustment may be indicated.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
