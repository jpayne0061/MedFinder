<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>5 mg, 10 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) with more rapid onset of action than imipramine. Has little if any sedative properties characteristic
         of most other TCAs, but causes tachycardia, CNS stimulation, and strong anticholinergic activity. Orthostatic hypotension
         occurs frequently with usage.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>TCAs potentiate both norepinephrine and serotonin in CNS by blocking their reuptake by presynaptic neurons. Effective in the
         treatment of mentally depressed individuals particularly those who are withdrawn.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Symptomatic treatment of endogenous depression in patients under close medical supervision. Particularly effective for depression
         manifested by psychomotor retardation, apathy, and fatigue.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Use in children; concurrent use of <small>MAOI</small>s; during acute recovery phase following MI; pregnancy (category C).
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Hepatic, cardiovascular, or kidney dysfunction; diabetes mellitus; hyperthyroidism; patients with insomnia; lactation.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Give whole or crush and mix with fluid or food.</li>
<li>Give dosage increases in the morning dose to prevent sleep interference and because this TCA has psychic energizing action.</li>
<li>Give last dose of day no later than midafternoon; insomnia rather than drowsiness is a frequent adverse effect.</li>
<li>Store at 15°30° C (59°86° F) in tightly closed container.</li>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor therapeutic effectiveness. Onset of initial effect characterized by increased activity and energy is fairly rapid,
            usually within 1 wk after therapy is initiated. Maximum effect may not occur for 2 wk or more.
         </li>
<li>Monitor vital signs closely and CV system responses during early therapy, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disorders
            and older adults receiving daily doses in excess of 20 mg. Withhold drug and inform physician if BP falls more than 20 mm
            Hg or if there is a sudden increase in pulse rate.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Obtain periodic liver function and blood cell counts in patients receiving large doses for prolonged periods or
            in combination with other drugs.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O ratio and question patient about bowel regularity during early therapy and when patient is on large doses.</li>
<li>Assess and advise physician as indicated for prominent anticholinergic effects (xerostomia, blurred vision, constipation,
            paralytic ileus, urinary retention, delayed micturition).
         </li>
<li>Assess condition of oral membranes frequently; institute symptomatic treatment if necessary. Xerostomia can interfere with
            appetite, fluid intake, and integrity of tooth surfaces.
         </li>
<li>Supervise patient closely during early treatment period. Suicide is an inherent risk with any depressed patient and may remain
            until there is significant improvement.
         </li>
<li>Bear in mind that the potentiation of TCA effects may increase the danger of overdosage or suicide attempt (especially in
            patients who use excessive amounts of alcohol).
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Consult physician about safe amount of alcohol, if any, that can be taken. Actions of both alcohol and protriptyline are potentiated
            when used together for up to 2 wk after the TCA is discontinued.
         </li>
<li>Stop or to reduce smoking; smoking reduces TCAs effectiveness. Apparent treatment failure may be due to the nicotine effect.</li>
<li>Consult physician before taking any OTC medications.</li>
<li>Be aware that effects of barbiturates and other CNS depressants are enhanced by TCAs.</li>
<li>Avoid potentially hazardous activities requiring alertness and skill until response to drug is known.</li>
<li>Avoid exposure to the sun without protecting skin with sunscreen lotion (SPF &gt;12). Photosensitivity reactions may occur.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
