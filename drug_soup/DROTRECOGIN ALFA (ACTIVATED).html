<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Drotrecogin alfa is a recombinant form of Human Activated Protein C. Protein C deficiencies are found in most septic patients
         and result in a higher mortality rate. Activated Protein C exerts antithrombotic and anticoagulant effects by inhibiting clotting
         Factor Va and VIIIa. Activated Protein C may exert an antiinflammatory effect by inhibiting human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
         produced by monocytes, and by limiting the thrombin-induced inflammatory responses of the endothelial lining of the vasculature.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Drotrecogin alfa possesses anticoagulant, profibrinolytic and antiinflammatory properties.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Reduction in mortality in patients with severe sepsis and evidence of organ dysfunction.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Prior hypersensitivity to drotrecogin alfa; chronic severe hepatic disease; active internal bleeding or trauma; recent hemorrhagic
         stroke (within 3 months); invasive surgery or invasive procedures; recent intracranial or intraspinal surgery, or severe head
         trauma (within 2 mo); intracranial neoplasm, lesion, aneurysm, or herniation; presence of an epidural catheter; pregnancy
         (category C), lactation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Immunosuppression; increased risk of bleeding, hypercoagulability; concurrent use of anticoagulants, or aspirin; children

                  directing stream to side of bag to minimize agitation, then gently invert to mix. Final concentration should be 100200

                  is typically diluted to a final concentration of 1001000 mcg/mL.

<ul>
<li>Monitor closely for S&amp;S of hemorrhage. Stop infusion immediately should clinically important bleeding occur. There is no antidote
            for drotrecogin alfa.
         </li>
<li>Discontinue drotrecogin alfa 2 h prior to invasive procedures with an inherent risk of bleeding. Reinitiation may be reconsidered
            12 h after major invasive procedure or immediately after uncomplicated less invasive procedures.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Monitor closely PT; APTT is not a reliable indication of coagulation.</li>
