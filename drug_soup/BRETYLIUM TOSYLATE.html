<p>2 mg/mL, 4 mg/mL, 50 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Mechanism of action is complex and not fully understood. Suppresses ventricular fibrillation by direct action on the myocardium
         and ventricular tachycardia by adrenergic blockade. Shortly after administration, norepinephrine is released from adrenergic
         postganglionic nerve terminals, resulting in a moderate increase in BP, heart rate, and ventricular irritability. Subsequently,
         (12 h) drug-induced release and reuptake of norepinephrine are blocked, leading to a state resembling surgical sympathectomy.
         Orthostatic hypotension commonly occurs as a result of peripheral adrenergic blockade; some degree of hypotension may occur
         even while patient is supine. In most patients, tolerance to this effect develops after several days.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Suppresses arrhythmias with a reentry mechanism and decreases dispersion of ectopic foci. PR, QT, and QRS intervals are unchanged.
         Because onset of desired action is delayed, bretylium is not a first-line antiarrhythmic agent.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Short-term prophylaxis and treatment of ventricular fibrillation; life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation
         not responsive to conventional therapy [e.g., lidocaine, procainamide, direct current (cardioversion)].
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>No contraindications for use in life-threatening refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Safety during pregnancy (category C),
         lactation, or in children is not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Digitalis-induced arrhythmias, patients with fixed cardiac output (e.g., severe aortic stenosis or severe pulmonary hypertension
         because profound hypotension may result), sinus bradycardia, patients on digitalis maintenance, angina pectoris; impaired
         renal function.

<ul>
<li>Anticipate vomiting. IV administration is associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting. These side effects can
            be minimized by slow administration of drug (<img src="../images/special/greaterorequal.gif"/>10 min).
         </li>
<li>Establish baseline readings and monitor BP and ECG when drug is administered. Observe for initial transient rise in BP, increased
            heart rate, PVCs and other arrhythmias, or worsening of existing arrhythmias, which may occur within a few minutes to 1 h
            after drug administration. Keep physician informed. Initial effect of hypertension is usually followed within 1 h by a fall
            in supine BP and by orthostatic hypotension.
         </li>
<li>Use supine position until patient develops tolerance to hypotensive effect of bretylium (generally in several days). Hypotension
            can occur in the supine position, particularly in patients with severely compromised cardiac function. It may not readily
            respond to therapy (e.g., vasopressors, fluids); early reporting is essential.
         </li>
<li>Raise or lower head of bed slowly; advise patient to make position changes slowly in order to prevent orthostatic hypotension.</li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O, particularly in patients with impaired renal function.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Make position changes slowly. If allowed to be out of bed, dangle legs for a few minutes before standing, but do not stand
            still for prolonged periods. Men should sit on toilet to urinate.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
