<p>Eletriptan is a potent agonist at central serotonin 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptors, and has modest affinity for 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1E</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors. Eletriptan stimulates presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors inhibiting dural vasodilation and agonizes vascular 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors causing vasoconstriction of intracranial extracerebral vessels.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Inhibits dural vasodilation and inflammation, and causes vasoconstriction of painfully dilated intracranial extracerebral
         vessels, thus relieving the migraine headache. Also relieves photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea and vomiting associated
         with migraine attacks.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Treatment of acute migraine attacks with or without aura.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to eletriptan; CVA or TIA; within 24 h of administering of another ergotamine; pregnancy (category C), lactation
         within 24 h after dose; children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Hypotension in the elderly; lactation; mild to moderate hepatic impairment; ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease;
         diabetes, obesity, smoking, high cholesterol; history of coronary artery disease; men over 40 y of age; postmenopausal women.

<ul>
<li>Monitor CV status carefully following first dose in patients at risk for coronary artery disease (e.g., history of hypertension,
            postmenopausal women, men &gt;40 y, persons with known CAD risk factors) or who have coronary artery vasospasms.
         </li>
<li>Report immediately chest pain, tightness in chest or throat that is severe or does not quickly resolve following a dose of
            eletriptan.
         </li>
<li>Monitor therapeutic effectiveness. Pain relief is usually achieved within 1 h.</li>

            							Note: If first dose is ineffective, do not take a second dose as it will not work for the same attack.
            						
         </li>
<li>Inform physician of all prescription, nonprescription, and herbal drugs you are taking. Do not add additional drugs without
            informing physician as many drugs interact with eletriptan.

<li>Report promptly any of the following: headache more severe than usual, migraine; dizziness, faintness, blurred vision; chest,
            neck, or throat pain; irregular heart beat, palpitations; shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing; tingling, pain,
