<p>250 mcg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Synthetic analog of naturally occurring prostaglandin F<sub>2</sub> alpha with longer duration of biologic activity. Stimulates myometrial contractions of gravid uterus; contractions are qualitatively
         similar to those occurring at term labor. Mean time to abortion 16 h; mean dose required 2.6 mL. Length of time to abortion
         and total dose of carboprost required decrease with greater parity but increase with greater gestational age. Can be employed
         as abortifacient even if membranes are ruptured.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Effectively stimulates uterine contraction and is used to induce abortion over a wide range of gestational age. Useful in
         treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony unresponsive to usual measures.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>To induce abortion between 13th and 20th week of pregnancy, as calculated from first day of last menstrual period. Also for
         refractory postpartum bleeding.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>To reduce blood loss secondary to uterine atony; to induce labor in intrauterine fetal death and hydatidiform mole.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Acute pelvic inflammatory disease; active cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease; pregnancy (category D); lactation.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>History of asthma; adrenal disease; anemia; hypotension; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; epilepsy; history of uterine surgery;
         cervical stenosis; fibroids.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Because nausea and diarrhea occur in about 60% of patients, an antiemetic and an antidiarrheal agent may be prescribed
            before and during carboprost administration.
         </li>
<li>Give deep IM into a large muscle. Aspirate carefully before injecting drug to avoid inadvertent entry into blood vessel which
            can result in bronchospasm, tetanic contractions, and shock. Do not use same site for subsequent doses.
         </li>
<li>Store drug in refrigerator at 2°4° C (36°39° F) unless otherwise specified.</li>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor uterine contractions and observe and report excessive vaginal bleeding and cramping pain. Save all clots and tissue
            for physician inspection and laboratory analysis.
         </li>
<li>Check vital signs at regular intervals. Carboprost-induced febrile reaction occurs in more than 10% of patients and must
            be differentiated from endometritis, which occurs around third day after abortion.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report promptly onset of bleeding, foul-smelling discharge, abdominal pain, or fever.</li>
<li>Since ovulation may reoccur as early as 2 wk post-abortion, you may wish to consider appropriate contraception.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
