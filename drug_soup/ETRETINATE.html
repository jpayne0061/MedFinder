<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor therapeutic effectiveness. Transient exacerbation of psoriasis may occur during the initial treatment.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Perform baseline hepatic function tests prior to treatment, then at 1- to 2-wk intervals for 12 mo. Continue
            with periodic tests at intervals of 13 mo during treatment. Discontinue drug in presence of hepatitis. Determine blood
            lipid before treatment and repeat at 1- to 2-wk intervals until lipid response is established (usually 48 wk).
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Use effective contraception at least 1 mo before starting treatment, throughout treatment, and for as long as 4 y after treatment
            ends.
         </li>
<li> 							Note: Complete clearing of the disease has been observed after 49 mo of therapy in most patients. 						</li>
<li>Notify physician immediately of pain and limitation of motion; drug will be discontinued. Common sites for drug-induced hyperostosis
            (abnormal growth of bone tissue) in adults are in the ankles, pelvis, and knees. Promptly report similar pain and limitation
            of motion when drug is prescribed for child.
         </li>
<li>Notify physician immediately of S&amp;S of hepatitis: jaundice (see Appendix F), flu-like symptoms.</li>
<li>Discontinue drug if any visual difficulties develop and schedule an ophthalmic examination.</li>
<li>Avoid high-fat foods in diet because this drug can cause hypertriglyceridemia and increased LDLs.</li>
<li>Avoid vitamin A supplements because of the possibility of additive toxic effects.</li>
<li>Report early symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri: Headache, vomiting, nausea, blurred vision.</li>
<li>Avoid excessive sun exposure and sunlamp treatments because of potential drug-induced photosensitivity and photophobia.</li>
<li>Notify physician of dry mouth; drug-induced effects on oral mucosa and gingiva need to be treated.</li>
<li>Be completely aware of the teratogenic danger. Discuss the risk of becoming pregnant or continuing a pregnancy with your physician.</li>
<li>Do not donate blood while taking etretinate or for several years after therapy.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
