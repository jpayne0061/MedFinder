      <h1><a name="nursing"><span class="implictitle">Nursing Implications</span></a></h1>
<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Take complete medical and family history prior to initiation of OC therapy. Physical exam: Baseline and periodic BP, breasts,
            abdomen, pelvis, Pap smear, and other relevant tests.
         </li>
<li>Rule out pregnancy before OC therapy is begun.</li>
<li>Check BP periodically. In some women, changes in BP occur within each cycle; in others, slow increase of pressure, particularly
            diastolic, over several months is significant. Drug-induced BP elevation is usually reversible with cessation of OC.
         </li>
<li>Nausea with or without vomiting occurs in approximately 10% of patients during the first cycle and is reportedly one of
            the major reasons for voluntary discontinuation of therapy. Most adverse effects tend to disappear in third or fourth cycle
            of use. Instruct patient to report symptoms that persist after fourth cycle. Dose adjustment or a different product may be
            indicated.
         </li>
<li>Hirsutism and loss of hair are reversible with discontinuation of OC or by change of selected combination.</li>
<li>Acne may improve, worsen, or develop for first time. In women on OC for at least 1 y, postcontraceptive acne sometimes occurs
            34 mo after stopping drug and may continue for 612 mo.
         </li>
<li>Anovulation or amenorrhea following termination of OC regimen may persist more than 6 mo. The user with pretreatment oligomenorrhea
            or secondary amenorrhea is most apt to have oversuppression syndrome.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Use an additional method of birth control during the first week of the initial cycle.</li>
<li>Missed dose: Take tablet as soon as remembered or take 2 tablets the next day. If 2 consecutive tablets are omitted, take
            2 tablets daily for the next 2 d, then resume the regular schedule. If 3 consecutive tablets are missed, begin a new compact
            of tablets, starting 7 d after last tablet was taken.
         </li>
<li>Use an additional form of birth control for 7 d after 2 missed doses; 14 d after 3 missed doses.</li>
<li>Ovulation is unlikely with omission of 1 daily dose; however, the possibility of escaped ovulation, spotting, or breakthrough
            bleeding increases with each missed dose.
         </li>
<li>Discontinue medication if intra-cycle bleeding resembling menstruation occurs. Begin taking tablets from a new compact on
            day 5. If bleeding persists, see physician.
         </li>
<li>Transdermal patches: Apply only one patch at a time and never cut or otherwise alter a patch prior to application.</li>
<li>See physician to rule out pregnancy if 2 consecutive periods are missed, before continuing on OC.</li>
<li>Do not skip scheduled visits for physical checkups while on OC therapy. Learn breast self-examination and do every month.</li>
<li>Record frequent weight checks to permit early recognition of fluid retention.</li>
<li>Understand the increased risk of thromboembolic and cardiovascular problems and increased incidence of gallbladder disease
            with OC use. Be alert to manifestations of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders: severe headache (especially if persistent
            and recurrent), dizziness, blurred vision, leg or chest pain, respiratory distress, unexplained cough. Discontinue drug if
            any of these symptoms appear and report them promptly to physician.
         </li>
<li>Report sudden abdominal pain immediately to physician in order to rule out ectopic pregnancy.</li>
<li>Be aware that ophthalmic sequelae can occur as soon as 24 h after initiation of OC. Stop drug and contact physician if unexplained
            partial or complete, sudden or gradual loss of vision, protrusion of eyeballs (proptosis), or diplopia occurs.
         </li>
<li>Leukorrhea (increased clear discharge) is an expected physical reaction to the OC; however, if OC use is accompanied by vaginal
            itching and irritation, report to physician promptly to rule out candidiasis.
         </li>
<li>Monitor urine and blood glucose closely if diabetic. Adjustment of antidiabetic medication may be necessary.</li>
<li>Be aware that smokers using OC have a fivefold greater risk of fatal MI than nonsmoker OC users and a tenfold greater risk
            than non-OC users who are nonsmokers. The risk increases with age (marked in women &gt;35 y) and with heavy smoking (15 or more
            cigarettes/d).
         </li>
<li>Oral contraception can be started immediately after delivery in the nonlactating mother.</li>
<li>Use alternate method of birth control when breast feeding until infant is weaned.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
