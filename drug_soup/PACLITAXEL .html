<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1>
<p>
         			Note: Premedication with dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, and H<sub>2</sub> antagonists (or ephedrine) is recommended to reduce hypersensitivity reactions, and consists of dexamethasone 20 mg PO or
         IV 14 and 7 h prior to Taxol infusion; diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 30 min prior to Taxol; and cimetidine 300 mg or ranitidine
         50 mg IV 30 min before Taxol infusion.

<li>Follow institutional or standard guidelines for preparation, handling, and disposal of cytotoxic agents.</li>
<li>Premedicate (except with Abraxane) before using to avoid severe hypersensitivity.</li>

<p><span class="routemethod">PREPARE:</span> <span class="methodtype">IV Infusion:</span>
<b>Taxol &amp; Onxol:</b> Do not use equipment or devices containing polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in preparation of infusion. Dilute to a final concentration
                  of 0.31.2 mg/mL in any of the following: D5W, NS, D5/NS, or D5W in Ringer's injection. The prepared solution may be
                  hazy, but this does not indicate a loss of potency. <b>Abraxane:</b> Reconstitute vial by slowly injecting 20 mL NS over at least 1 min onto the inside wall of the vial to yield 5 mg/mL. DO
                  NOT inject directly into the cake powder. Allow vial to sit for at least 5 min, then gently swirl for at least 2 min to completely
                  dissolve. If foaming occurs, let stand for at least 15 min until foam subsides.  
               </p>
<p><span class="routemethod">ADMINISTER:</span> <span class="methodtype">IV Infusion:</span> Because tissue necrosis occurs with extravasation, frequently assess patency of a peripheral IV site. <b>Taxol &amp; Onxol:</b> The prepared solution may be hazy. Administer over 3 h through IV tubing containing inline (0.22 micron or less) filter.
                  Do not use equipment containing PVC. <b>Abraxane:</b> If particulates or settling are visible, gently invert vial to ensure complete resuspension prior to use. Inject the required
                  dose into an empty, sterile, PVC or non-PVC type IV bag. DO NOT use an in-line filter. Infuse over 30 min.

<ul>
<li>Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during first and second administrations of the paclitaxel. S&amp;S requiring
            treatment, but not necessarily discontinuation of the drug, include dyspnea, hypotension, and chest pain. Discontinue immediately
            and manage symptoms aggressively if angioedema and generalized urticaria develop.
         </li>
<li>Monitor vital signs frequently, especially during the first hour of infusion. Bradycardia occurs in approximately 12%
            of patients, usually during infusion. It does not normally require treatment. Cardiac monitoring is indicated for those with
            severe conduction abnormalities.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Monitor hematologic status throughout course of treatment. Severe neutropenia is common but usually of short duration
            (less than 500/mm<sup>3</sup> for less than 7 d) with the nadir occurring about day 11. Thrombocytopenia occurs less often and is less severe with the
            nadir around day 8 or 9. The incidence and severity of anemia increase with exposure to paclitaxel.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for peripheral neuropathy, the severity of which is dose dependent. Severe symptoms occur primarily with higher than
            recommended doses.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Immediately report to physician S&amp;S of paclitaxel hypersensitivity: difficulty breathing, chest pain, palpitations, angioedema
            (subcutaneous swelling usually around face and neck), and skin rashes or itching.
         </li>
<li>Be sure to have periodic blood work as prescribed.</li>
<li>Avoid aspirin, <small>NSAID</small>s, and alcohol to minimize GI distress.
         </li>
<li>Be aware of high probability of developing hair loss (&gt;80%).</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
