<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>2 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Potent aromatic derivative of the alkylating agent nitrogen mustard which is slowest acting and least toxic of the nitrogen
         mustards. A cell-cycle nonspecific drug (kills both resting and dividing cells), it causes cytotoxic cross linkage in DNA,
         thus preventing synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Myelosuppression in therapeutic doses is moderate and rapidly reversible.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Lymphocytic effect is marked, thus it is effective in treatment of various lymphomas.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>As single agent or in combination with other antineoplastics in treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, malignant lymphomas
         including lymphosarcoma, Hodgkin's disease, and giant follicular lymphoma, and in treatment of carcinoma of the ovary, breast,
         and testes.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Nonneoplastic conditions: vasculitis complicating rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemias associated with cold
         agglutinins, lupus glomerulonephritis, idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, polycythemia vera, macroglobulinemia.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to chlorambucil or to other alkylating agents; administration within 4 wk of a full course of radiation or
         chemotherapy; full dosage if bone marrow is infiltrated with lymphomatous tissue or is hypoplastic; smallpox and other vaccines;
         pregnancy (category D), lactation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Excessive or prolonged dosage, pneumococcus vaccination, history of seizures or head trauma.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lab tests: CBC, Hgb, total and differential leukocyte counts, and serum uric acid initially and at least once weekly during
            treatment.
         </li>
<li>Leukopenia usually develops after the third week of treatment; it may continue for up to 10 d after last dose, then rapidly
            return to normal.
         </li>
<li>Avoid or reduce to minimum injections and other invasive procedures (e.g., rectal temperatures, enemas) when platelet count
            is low because of danger of bleeding.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for S&amp;S of skin rashes, which are rare, but appear to show a consistent pattern: pustular eruption on mouth, chin,
            cheeks; urticarial erythema on trunk that spreads to legs. The rash occurs early in treatment period and lasts about 10 d
            after last dose.

<li>Report immediately the onset of cutaneous reaction.</li>
<li>Drink at least 1012 glasses (240 mL [8 oz] each) of fluid per day, if not contraindicated, and report to physician if
