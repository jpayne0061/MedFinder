<p>250,000 IU vial; 5,000 IU/mL vials</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Enzyme produced by kidneys and isolated from human kidney tissue cultures. Promotes thrombolysis by acting directly on the
         endogenous fibrinolytic system to convert plasminogen to the enzyme plasmin.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>The formation of plasmin is an action that occurs within as well as on the surface of a thrombus or embolus; plasmin has direct
         fibrinolytic action on a clot. Urokinase also has an anticoagulant effect because its action leads to high plasma levels of
         fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products. Its most effective action is on fresh, recently formed thrombi.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Lysis of acute massive pulmonary emboli and peripheral emboli and restoration of patency in occluded IV catheters (including
         central venous catheter); acute MI, retinal vessel occlusion, lysis of clot-occluded arteriovenous cannulas, and various other
         conditions associated with thromboembolization phenomenon.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Pregnancy (category B), lactation, and in children; active internal bleeding; very recent CPR; recent (within two months)
         intraspinal, intracranial, or intraarterial procedures; intracranial neoplasm, CVA, severe uncontrolled hypertension; history
         of allergic response to thrombolytic agent, recent streptococcal infection; obstetrical delivery; diabetic hemorrhagic retinopathy;
         ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis; any condition in which bleeding presents a hazard or would be difficult to manage because
         of location.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Patient with preexisting hemostatic deficits, conditions accompanied by risk of cerebral embolism, septic thrombophlebitis;
         uremia, hepatic failure.

<b>For IV Catheter Clearance</b>  Use Abbokinase Open-Cath without dilution or add 1 mL of initially reconstituted Abbokinase (50,000 IU/mL) to 9 mL
                  sterile water for injection to yield 5000 IU/mL.  <span class="methodtype">IV Infusion:</span>
<b>For Pulmonary Embolism</b>  Reconstitute each 250,000 IU vial of Abbokinase by adding 5 mL sterile water for injection (<b>

                  formation. May be terminally filtered through a 0.45 micron or smaller cellulose membrane. Reconstitute as many vials as needed
                  to achieve the required dose. Further dilute by adding the contents of each vial to enough NS or D5W to produce a final volume
                  of 195 mL for infusion. Use immediately. <b>For Coronary Artery Thrombosis</b>  Reconstitute three vials of Abbokinase as described above. Further dilute by adding the contents of the three vials

            							Note: Anticoagulant therapy with heparin is reinstituted at end of urokinase therapy and when thrombin time has decreased to less
