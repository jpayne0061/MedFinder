<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Preparation of desiccated animal thyroid gland containing active thyroid hormones, <i>l</i>-thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) and <i>l</i>-triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>). Action mechanism unknown; T<sub>4</sub> is largely converted to T<sub>3</sub>, which exerts the principal effects.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Influences growth and maturation of various tissues (including skeletal and CNS) at critical periods. Promotes a generalized
         increase in metabolic rate of body tissues. Indicated by diuresis, accompanied by loss of weight and puffiness, followed by
         sense of well-being, increased pulse rate, increased pulse pressure, increased appetite, increased psychomotor activity, loss
         of constipation, normalization of skin texture and hair, and increased T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> serum levels.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Replacement or substitution therapy in primary hypothyroidism (cretinism, myxedema, simple goiter, deficiency states in pregnancy
         and older adults) and secondary hypothyroidism caused by surgery, excess radiation, or antithyroid drug therapy. May be given
         as adjunct to antithyroid agents when it is desirable to limit release of thyrotropic hormones and to prevent goitrogenesis
         and hypothyroidism.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Thyrotoxicosis; acute MI uncomplicated by hypothyroidism, cardiovascular disease; morphologic hypogonadism; nephrosis; uncorrected
         hypoadrenalism.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Angina pectoris, hypertension, older adults who may have occult cardiac disease; renal insufficiency; concomitant administration
         of catecholamines; diabetes mellitus; hyperthyroidism (history of); malabsorption states; pregnancy (category A), lactation.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Observe patient carefully during initial treatment for untoward reactions such as angina, palpitations, cardiac pain.</li>
<li>Be alert for symptoms of overdosage (see <small>ADVERSE EFFECTS</small>) that may occur 13 wk after therapy is started. If they develop, interrupt treatment for several days and restart with
            reduced dosage.
         </li>
<li>Monitor response until regimen is stabilized to prevent iatrogenic hyperthyroidism. In drug-induced hyperthyroidism, there
            may also be increased bone loss. Such a patient is vulnerable to pathologic fractures.
         </li>
<li>Monitor vital signs: Pulse rate is an important clue to drug effectiveness. Assess pulse before each dose during period of
            dosage adjustment. Consult physician if rate is 100 or more or if there has been a marked change in rate or rhythm.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Monitor thyroid function q3mo during dose adjustment period. Monitor prothrombin time closely if patient is receiving
            concurrent anticoagulant therapy. A decrease in requirement usually develops within 14 wk after starting treatment with
            thyroid.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that toxic effects of thyroid develop slowly and disappear gradually. T<sub>4</sub> effects require up to 36 wk to dissipate; T<sub>3</sub> effects last 614 d after drug withdrawal.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Adhere to established dosage regimen; do not change dose intervals without approval of the physician.</li>
<li>Be aware that replacement therapy for hypothyroidism is life-long; continued follow-up care is important.</li>
<li>Do not change brands of thyroid unless physician approves. Hormone content varies among brands.</li>
<li>Monitor pulse rate and report increases greater than parameter set by physician.</li>
<li>Report onset of chest pain or other signs of aggravated CV disease (dyspnea, tachycardia) to physician promptly.</li>
<li>Report evidence of any unexplained bleeding to physician when taking concomitant anticoagulant.</li>
<li>Use serial height and weight measurement to monitor growth in juvenile undergoing treatment.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
