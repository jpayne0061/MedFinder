<p>250,000 IU, 750,000 IU, 1,500,000 IU vials</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Derivative of the beta-hemolytic streptococci. Promotes thrombolysis by activating the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin,
         the enzyme that degrades fibrin, fibrinogen, and other procoagulant proteins into soluble fragments. Decreases blood and plasma
         viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation tendency, thus increasing perfusion of collateral blood vessels.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Promotes thrombolysis. The fibrinolytic activity of streptokinase is effective both outside and within the formed thrombus/embolus.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Acute extensive deep venous thrombosis, acute arterial thrombosis or embolism, acute pulmonary embolus, coronary artery thrombosis,
         MI, and arteriovenous cannula occlusion.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Active internal bleeding; very recent cardiopulmonary resuscitation; recent (within 2 mo) intraspinal, intracranial, intraarterial
         procedures; intracranial neoplasm; CVA, severe uncontrolled hypertension; history of allergic response to SK, recent streptococcal
         infection; obstetrical delivery; diabetic hemorrhagic retinopathy; ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis; any condition in which
         bleeding presents a hazard or would be difficult to manage because of location; pregnancy (category C). Safety and efficacy
         in children are not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Patient with preexisting hemostatic deficits; conditions accompanied by risk of cerebral embolism; septic thrombophlebitis;
         uremia; liver failure; lactation.

<tr>

                  increase in flocculation. Further dilute by carefully adding an additional 40 mL to the vial, avoiding shaking or agitation
                  of the solution. If necessary, may be further diluted in 45 mL increments to approximately 500 mL. Slight flocculation does
                  not interfere with drug action; discard solution with large amount of flocculent.  
               </p>
<p><span class="routemethod">ADMINISTER:</span> <span class="methodtype">IV Infusion:</span>  Start IV infusion as soon as possible after the thrombotic event; thrombi more than 7 d old respond poorly to SK therapy.
                  Give at rate specified under Route &amp; Dosage for specific indication (e.g., 1.5 million IU over 60 min for coronary artery
                  thrombosis). Observe infusion site frequently. If phlebitis occurs, it can usually be controlled by diluting the infusion
                  solution.

<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Discontinue heparin and obtain baseline control levels for TT, aPTT, PT, INR, Hct, and platelet count prior to
            treatment. Treatment is delayed until TT and aPTT are less than 2 times the normal control level. During treatment with SK,
            TT is generally kept at about 2 times or more baseline value and checked q34h.
         </li>
<li>Protect patient from invasive procedures: IM injections are contraindicated. Also prevent undue manipulation during thrombolytic
            therapy to prevent bruising. Spontaneous bleeding occurs about twice as often with SK as with heparin.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for excessive bleeding q15min for the first hour of therapy, q30min for second to eighth hour, then q8h.</li>
<li>Be aware that patient is at risk for postthrombolytic bleeding for 24 d after intracoronary SK treatment. Continue monitoring
            vital signs until laboratory tests confirm anticoagulant control.
         </li>
<li>Report signs of potential serious bleeding; gum bleeding, epistaxis, hematoma, spontaneous ecchymoses, oozing at catheter
            site, increased pulse, pain from internal bleeding. SK infusion should be interrupted, then resumed when bleeding stops.
         </li>
<li>Report promptly symptoms of a major allergic reaction; therapy will be discontinued and emergency treatment instituted. Minor
            symptoms (e.g., itching, nausea) respond to concurrent antihistamine or corticosteroid treatment or both without interruption
            of SK administration.
         </li>
<li>Check cardiac monitor frequently. Be alert to changes in cardiac rhythm, especially during intracoronary instillation. Dysrhythmias
            signal need to stop therapy at once.
         </li>
<li>Monitor BP. Mild changes can be expected, but report substantial changes (greater than ±25 mm Hg). Therapy may be discontinued.</li>
<li>Check patient's temperature during treatment. A slight elevation, 0.8° C (1.5° F), perhaps with chills, occurs in
            about one third of the patients. Higher elevations may be treated with acetaminophen.
         </li>
<li>Avoid giving aspirin because of its antiplatelet action if an analgesic-antipyretic is indicated.</li>
