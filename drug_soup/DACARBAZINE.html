<li>IV administration to infants and children: Verify correct IV concentration and rate of infusion with physician.</li>
<li>Wear gloves when handling this drug. If solution gets into the eyes, wash them with soap and water immediately, then irrigate
                     with water or isotonic saline.

<p><span class="routemethod">PREPARE:</span> <span class="methodtype">Direct:</span>  Reconstitute drug with sterile water for injection to make a solution containing 10 mg/mL dacarbazine (pH 3.04.0) by
                  adding 9.9 mL to 100 mg or 19.8 mL to 200 mg.  <span class="methodtype">IV Infusion:</span> Dilute further in 50 mL of D5W or NS.

                  lead to loss of mobility of entire limb. Avoid veins in extremity with compromised venous or lymphatic drainage and veins
                  near joint spaces.

<ul>
<li>Administer dacarbazine only to patients under close supervision because close observation and frequent laboratory studies
                     are required during and after therapy.
                  </li>
<li>IV extravasation: Monitor injection site frequently (instruct patient to do so, if able). Give prompt attention to patient's
                     complaint of swelling, stinging, and burning sensation around injection site. Extravasation can occur painlessly and without
                     visual signs. Danger areas for extravasation are dorsum of hand or ankle (especially if peripheral arteriosclerosis is present),
                     joint spaces, and previously irradiated areas. If extravasation is suspected, infusion should be stopped immediately and restarted
                     in another vein. Report to the physician. Prompt institution of local treatment is <small>IMPERATIVE</small>.

<ul>
<li>Monitor IV site carefully for extravasation; if suspected, discontinue IV immediately and notify physician.</li>
<li>
            							Note: Skin damage by dacarbazine can lead to deep necrosis requiring surgical debridement, skin grafting, and even amputation. Older
            adults, the very young, comatose, and debilitated patients are especially at risk. Other risk factors include establishing
            an IV line in a vein previously punctured several times and the use of nonplastic catheters.
            						
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Monitor for hematopoietic toxicity that usually appears about 4 wk after first dose. Generally, a leukocyte count
            of 3 and a platelet count of 3 require suspension or cessation of therapy.
         </li>
<li>Avoid, if possible, all tests and treatments during platelet nadir requiring needle punctures (e.g., IM). Observe carefully
            and report evidence of unexplained bleeding.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for severe nausea and vomiting (&gt;90% of patients) that begin within 1 h after drug administration and may last
            for as long as 12 h.
         </li>
<li>Check patient's mouth for ulcerative stomatitis prior to the administration of each dose.</li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O ratio and pattern and daily temperature. Renal impairment extends the half-life and increases danger of toxicity.
            Report symptoms of renal dysfunction and even a slight elevation of temperature.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn about all potential adverse drug effects.</li>
<li>Report flu-like syndrome that may occur during or even a week after treatment is terminated and last 721 d. Symptoms
            frequently recur with successive treatments.
         </li>
<li>Avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight or to ultraviolet light during treatment period and for at least 2 wk after last dose.
            Protect exposed skin with sunscreen lotion (SPF 15) and avoid exposure in midday.
         </li>
<li>Report promptly the onset of blurred vision or paresthesia.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
