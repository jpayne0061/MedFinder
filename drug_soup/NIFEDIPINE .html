<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>10 mg, 20 mg capsules; 30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg sustained release tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Calcium channel blocking agent that selectively blocks calcium ion influx across cell membranes of cardiac muscle and vascular
         smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. Class IV antiarrhythmic.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Reduces myocardial oxygen utilization and supply and relaxes and prevents coronary artery spasm; has little or no effect on
         SA and AV nodal conduction with therapeutic dosing. Decreases peripheral vascular resistance and increases cardiac output.
         Vasodilation of both coronary and peripheral vessels is greater than that produced by verapamil or diltiazem and frequently
         results in reflex tachycardia. Decreased peripheral vascular resistance also leads to a rise in peripheral blood flow, the
         basis for use of this drug in treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon. Minimal effect on myocardial contractility.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Vasospastic "variant" or Prinzmetal's angina and chronic stable angina without vasospasm. Mild to moderate hypertension
         alone or in combination with a diuretic.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Esophageal disorders; vascular headaches; Raynaud's phenomenon; asthma; cardiomyopathy; primary pulmonary hypertension.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Known hypersensitivity to nifedipine. Safety during pregnancy (category C) or in children is not established.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Concomitant use with hypotensives; CHF; lactation.</p>

<li>Do not give within the first 12 wk following an MI.</li>
<li>Use only the sustained release form to treat chronic hypertension. Ensure that sustained release form is not chewed or crushed.
            It must be swallowed whole.
         </li>
<li>Discontinue drug gradually, with close medical supervision to prevent severe hypertension and other adverse effects.</li>
<li>Store at 15°25° C (59°77° F); protect from light and moisture.</li>

<ul>
<li>Monitor BP carefully during titration period. Patient may become severely hypotensive, especially if also taking other drugs
            known to lower BP. Withhold drug and notify physician if systolic BP 
         </li><li>Monitor blood sugar in diabetic patients. Nifedipine has diabetogenic properties.</li>
<li>Monitor for gingival hyperplasia and report promptly. This is a rare but serious adverse effect (similar to phenytoin-induced
            hyperplasia).
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a record of nitroglycerin use and promptly report any changes in previous pattern. Occasionally, people develop increased
            frequency, duration, and severity of angina when they start treatment with this drug or when dosage is increased.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that withdrawal symptoms may occur with abrupt discontinuation of the drug (chest pain, increase in anginal episodes,
            MI, dysrhythmias).
         </li>
<li>Inspect gums visually every day. Changes in gingivae may be gradual, and bleeding may be exhibited only with probing.</li>
<li>Seek prompt treatment for symptoms of gingival hyperplasia (easy bleeding of gingivae and gradual enlarging of gingival mass,
            especially on buccal side of lower anterior teeth). Drug will be discontinued if gingival hyperplasia occurs.
         </li>
<li>Research shows that smoking decreases the efficacy of nifedipine and has direct and adverse effects on the heart in the patient
            on nifedipine treatment.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
