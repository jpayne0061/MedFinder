<p>50 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>An immunoglobulin (IgG) and lymphocyte-selective immunosuppressant derived from serum of healthy horses that have been immunized
         with human thymus lymphocytes. Action mechanism is not clear. Produces little effect on B-lymphocyte cells and is not associated
         with severe lymphopenia. Increases susceptibility of patient to viral infections; it may reactivate or support infection with
         cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus (especially labial infections), or with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). As with other immunosuppressant
         agents, carcinogenicity of this drug may be expressed.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Alters the formation of T lymphocytes (killer cells) and reduces their number.</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Primarily to prevent or delay onset or to reverse acute renal allograft rejection.</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Moderate and severe aplastic anemia in patients unsuitable for bone marrow transplantation, T-cell malignancy, acute and chronic
         graft-vs-host disease, and to prevent rejection of skin allografts.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to thimerosal (preservative) or to other equine gamma globulin preparations; history of previous systemic
         reaction to ATG, hemorrhagic diatheses; leporine protein hypersensitivity; use in kidney transplant patient not receiving
         a concomitant immunosuppressant; fungal or viral infections; pregnancy (category C), lactation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Children (experience limited); hypotension, infection, leukopenia, lymphoma, neoplastic disease, thrombocytopenia, vaccination,
         varicella.

<li>Administer lymphocyte immune globulin (ATG) <small>ONLY</small> if experienced with immunosuppressant therapy and management of kidney transplant patients.
                  </li>
<li>Do an intradermal skin test to rule out allergy to the drug before first dose. Inject 0.1 mL of a 1:1000 dilution (5 mcg equine
                     IgG in normal saline) and a saline control. If local reaction occurs (wheal or erythema more than 10 mm) or if there is pseudopod
                     formation, itching, or local swelling, use caution during infusion. Discontinue infusion if systemic reaction develops (generalized
                     rash, tachycardia, dyspnea, hypotension, anaphylaxis).

<ul>
<li>Discontinue infusion and initiate appropriate therapy promptly with onset of anaphylactic response (respiratory distress;
            pain in chest, flank, back; hypotension, anxiety).
         </li>
<li>Monitor BP, vital signs, and patient's complaints during entire administration period carefully. Prompt treatment is indicated
            for observed and reported symptoms of anaphylaxis (incidence: 1%), serum sickness, or allergic response. Always have equipment
            for assisted respiration, epinephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroid, and vasopressor available at bedside.
         </li>
<li>Predictive value of skin test is not proven. Observe patient carefully; allergic reaction can occur even when test is negative.</li>
<li>Watch closely for S&amp;S of serum sickness: fever, malaise, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, lymphadenopathy and morbilliform eruptions
            on trunk and extremities. Rash begins as asymptomatic pale pink macules in periumbilical region, axilla, and groin, then rapidly
            becomes generalized, erythematous, and confluent. Bands of progressive erythema along the sides of hands, fingers, feet, toes,
            and at margins of palm or plantar skin are characteristic. In ATG-induced serum sickness, when platelet count is low, petechiae
            and purpura rapidly replace rash distribution over the body. Petechial areas are especially noticeable on legs but also on
            palms and soles. Serum sickness usually occurs 618 d after initiation of therapy; may occur during drug administration
            or when treatment is stopped.
         </li>
<li>Monitor carefully for S&amp;S of thrombocytopenia, concurrent infection, and leukopenia; patient usually receives concomitant
            corticosteroids and antimetabolites.
         </li>
<li>Monitor patient's temperature and attend to complaints of sore throat or rhinorrhea. Report to physician; ATG treatment may
            be stopped.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Notify physician immediately of pain in chest, flank, or back; chills; pruritus; night sweats; sore throat.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
