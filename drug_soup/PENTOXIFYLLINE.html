<p>400 mg tablets; 400 mg sustained release tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Useful in restoration of blood flow through nutritive capillary microcirculation that has been compromised by structural and
         flow dynamic changes in cerebral and peripheral vascular disorders. Action mechanism unclear, but drug action interrupts the
         vicious cycle of tissue hypoxia, sludging and stasis of capillary blood flow, microthrombotic activity, reduced oxygen delivery
         to ischemic cells.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Decreased blood viscosity and improved blood flow, with consequent reduction of tissue hypoxia. Resultant increased blood
         flow to the extremities reduces pain and paresthesia of intermittent claudication; further, psychopathologic conditions associated
         with cerebral hypoxia are improved.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Intermittent claudication associated with occlusive peripheral vascular disease; diabetic angiopathies.</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>To improve psychopathologic symptoms in patient with cerebrovascular insufficiency and to reduce incidence of stroke in the
         patient with recurrent TIAs.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Intolerance to pentoxifylline or to methylxanthines (caffeine and theophylline). Safety in pregnancy (category C), lactation,
         or in children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Angina, hypotension, arrhythmias, cerebrovascular disease.</p>

<ul>
<li>Monitor therapeutic effectiveness which is indicated by relief from pain and cramping in calf muscles, buttocks, thighs, and
            feet during exercise and improves walking performance (time and duration).
         </li>
<li>Monitor BP if patient is also on antihypertensive treatment. Drug may slightly decrease an already stabilized BP, necessitating
            a reduced dose of the hypotensive drug.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Consult physician to determine CV status and capacity before reestablishing walking as exercise.</li>
<li>Pay particular attention to care of the feet because of arterial insufficiency (diminished perfusion to feet).</li>
<li>Be aware that bleeding and prolonged PT/INR associated with this treatment have been reported. Report promptly unexplained
            bleeding, easy bruising, nose bleed, pinpoint rash to physician.
         </li>
<li>Avoid driving or working with hazardous machinery until drug response has stabilized because of potential for tiredness, blurred
            vision, dizziness.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
