<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>10 mg capsules, 20 mcg/mL solution; 1% lotion</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Psoralen derivative with strong photosensitizing effects: used with ultraviolet-A light (UVA) in therapeutic regimens called
         PUVA (P-psoralen). After photoactivation by long wavelength, UVA, methoxsalen combines with epidermal cell DNA causing photodamage
         (cytotoxic action).
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Photodamage inhibits rapid and uncontrolled epidermal cell turnover characteristic of psoriasis. Results in an inflammatory
         reaction with erythema. Strongly melanogenic.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>With controlled exposure to UVA to repigment vitiliginous skin and for symptomatic treatment of severe disabling psoriasis
         that is refractory to other forms of therapy.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>(PUVA therapy) mycosis fungoides.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Sunburn, sensitivity (or its history) to psoralens, diseases associated with photosensitivity (e.g., LE, albinism, melanoma
         or its history); invasive squamous cell cancer; cataract; aphakia; previous exposure to arsenic or ionizing radiation; pregnancy
         (category C). Safety (oral) in children is not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Hepatic insufficiency; GI disease; chronic infection; treatment with known photosensitizing agents; immunosuppressed patient;
         cardiovascular disease; lactation. Safety (lotion) in children

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1>
<ul>
<li> 					Note: Methoxsalen therapy with UV light (PUVA therapy) should be done under the complete control of a physician with special competence
            and experience in photochemotherapy. 				
         </li>
</ul><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give with milk or food to prevent GI distress.</li>
<li>Maintain consistent time relationship between fooddrug ingestion. Food digestion and absorption appear to affect drug
            serum levels.
         </li>
</ul><span class="adminroutetype">Topical</span><br/><ul>
<li>Only small (less than 10 cm<sup>2</sup>), well-defined areas are treated with lotion. Systemic treatment is used for large areas.
         </li>
<li>Apply lotion with cotton swabs, allow to dry 12 min, then reapply. Protect borders of the lesion with petrolatum and
            sunscreen lotion to prevent hyperpigmentation.
         </li>
<li>Use finger cots or gloves to apply lotion and prevent photosensitization and burned skin.</li>
<li>Apply sunscreen lotion to the skin for about one third of the initial exposure time during PUVA therapy until there is sufficient
            tanning. Do not apply to psoriatic areas before treatment.
         </li>
<li>Store lotion and capsules at 15°30° C (59°86° F) in light-resistant containers unless otherwise
            directed by manufacturer.
         </li>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule a pretreatment ophthalmologic exam to rule out cataracts; repeat periodically during treatment and at yearly intervals
            thereafter.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Monitor CBC, kidney and liver function, and antinuclear antibody tests during oral therapy.</li>
<li>Fair-skinned patients appear to be at greatest risk for phototoxicity from PUVA therapy (see <small>ADVERSE EFFECTS</small>).
         </li>
<li>Be aware that repigmentation is more rapid on fleshy areas (i.e., face, abdomen, buttocks) than on hands or feet.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Expect that effective repigmentation may require 69 mo of treatment; periodic treatment usually is necessary to retain
            pigmentation. If, after 3 mo of treatment, there is no apparent response, drug is discontinued.
         </li>
<li>Avoid additional exposure to UV light (direct or indirect) for at least 8 h after oral drug ingestion and UVA exposure.</li>
<li>Understand intended treatment schedule: After topical application, the initial sunlight exposure is limited to 1 min, with
            subsequent gradual and incremental exposures by prescription.
         </li>
<li>Avoid additional UV light for 2448 h after topical application and UVA exposure.</li>
<li>Wear sunscreen lotion (with SPF 15 or higher) and protective clothing (hat, gloves) to cover all exposed areas including lips,
            to prevent burning or blistering if sunlight cannot be avoided after the treatment.
         </li>
<li>Do not sunbathe for at least 48 h after PUVA treatment. Sunburn and photochemotherapy are additive in the production of burning
            and erythema.
         </li>
<li>Wear wraparound sunglasses with UVA-absorbing properties both indoors and outdoors during daylight hours for 24 h. Do not
            substitute prescription sunglasses or photosensitive darkening glasses; they may actually increase danger of cataract formation.
         </li>
<li>Alert physician to appearance of new psoriatic areas, flares, or regressed cleared skin areas during treatment and maintenance
            periods.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
