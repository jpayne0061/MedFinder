<p>50 mg capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Exerts a slow bactericidal effect on <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i> (Hansen's bacillus). Binds preferentially to DNA of all mycobacteria and inhibits their growth. Its antiinflammatory action
         (precise mechanism unknown) controls erythema nodosum leprosum reactions. Bacterial killing is not detectable in biopsy tissue
         from leprosy patient until 50 d after start of therapy.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Exerts a slow bactericidal effect on <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i> (Hansen's bacillus) and has antiinflammatory activity. Clofazimine is not effective against all forms of leprosy. Does not
         show cross-resistance with rifampin or dapsone. Has no clinically useful activity against microorganisms other than mycobacteria.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Chiefly in multiinfective therapy of multibacillary leprosy (with dapsone, rifampin, ethionamide) to prevent development of
         drug resistance. Also in lepromatous leprosy, including dapsone-resistant lepromatous leprosy and leprosy complicated by erythema
         nodosum leprosum (lepra) reaction.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>
<i>Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex</i> infections in patients with AIDS.

<ul>
<li>Assess for serious adverse effects (e.g., pain in bones and joints, GI bleeding, diminished vision). Reactions are usually
            reversible but may require months or years to diminish.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Periodic WBC with differential, serum electrolytes, serum albumin, and liver function tests.</li>
<li>Drug-induced reddish-brown discoloration of skin, cornea, conjunctiva, and body fluids (including tears, sweat, sputum, urine,
            and feces) occurs in 7590% of patients within a few weeks of treatment. Skin discoloration may take months or years
            to disappear after drug is discontinued.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for the onset of tender, erythematous nodules with lymphadenopathy, joint swelling, epistaxis, iritis which suggests
            a type 2 leprosy reactional state. Dosage may be increased to 200 mg/d. After reactive episode is controlled, dosage is tapered
            to 100 mg/d as soon as possible. Patient should remain under medical surveillance during the episode.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Adhere strictly to established drug regimen. No drug dosage should be omitted, increased, or decreased without advice of physician.</li>
<li>Report promptly bone and joint pain; GI bleeding, colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; diminished vision.</li>
<li>Minimize use of soap, avoid applying it directly to dry skin, and thoroughly rinse it off.</li>
<li>When dizziness, drowsiness, or visual impairment adverse effects are experienced, do not drive or work with hazardous equipment.
            These symptoms are generally dose related. Discuss with physician.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug.</li>
