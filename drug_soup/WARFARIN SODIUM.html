<p>1 mg, 2 mg, 2.5 mg, 3 mg, 4 mg, 5 mg, 6 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg tablets; 2 mg injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Indirectly interferes with blood clotting by depressing hepatic synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors: II,
         VII, IX, and X.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Deters further extension of existing thrombi and prevents new clots from forming. Unlike heparin, its action is cumulative
         and more prolonged. Warfarin is not cross allergenic with other coumarin derivatives. Does not reverse ischemic tissue damage
         and has no effect on platelets. Has no effect on already synthesized circulating coagulation factors or on circulating thrombi.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Prophylaxis and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and its extension, pulmonary embolism; treatment of atrial fibrillation
         with embolization. Also used as adjunct in treatment of coronary occlusion, cerebral transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and
         as a prophylactic in patients with prosthetic cardiac valves. Used extensively as rodenticide.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hemorrhagic tendencies, vitamin C or K deficiency, hemophilia, coagulation factor deficiencies, dyscrasias; active bleeding;
         open wounds, active peptic ulcer, visceral carcinoma, esophageal varices, malabsorption syndrome; hypertension (diastolic
         BP &gt;110 mm Hg), cerebral vascular disease; heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT); pericarditis with acute MI; severe hepatic
         or renal disease; continuous tube drainage of any orifice; subacute bacterial endocarditis; recent surgery of brain, spinal
         cord, or eye; regional or lumbar block anesthesia; threatened abortion; unreliable patients; pregnancy (category X).
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Alcoholism, allergic disorders, during menstruation, older adults, senility, psychosis; debilitated patients. Endogenous factors
         that may increase prothrombin time response (enhance anticoagulant effect): carcinoma, CHF, collagen diseases, hepatic and
         renal insufficiency, diarrhea, fever, pancreatic disorders, malnutrition, vitamin K deficiency. Endogenous factors that may
         decrease prothrombin time response (decrease anticoagulant response): edema, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia,
         chronic alcoholism, hereditary resistance to coumarin therapy.

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1>
<p>
         			Note: Antidote for bleedinganticoagulant effect usually is reversed by omitting 1 or more doses of warfarin and by administration
         of specific antidote phytonadione (vitamin K1) 2.510 mg orally. Physician may advise patient to carry vitamin K1 at
         all times, but not to take it until after consultation. If bleeding persists or progresses to a severe level, vitamin K 1525
         mg IV is given, or a fresh whole blood transfusion may be necessary.

      clinical importance of these reports has not been substantiated. The addition or withdrawal of any drug to an established

<ul>
<li>Determine PT/INP prior to initiation of therapy and then daily until maintenance dosage is established.</li>
<li>Obtain a <small>CAREFUL</small> medication history prior to start of therapy and whenever altered responses to therapy require interpretation; extremely
            <small>IMPORTANT</small> since many drugs interfere with the activity of anticoagulant drugs (see <small>INTERACTIONS</small>).
         </li>
<li>Adjust dose to maintain PT at 1½2½ times the control (1215 sec), or 1535% of normal prothrombin activity,
            or an INR of 24 depending on diagnosis.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: For maintenance dosage, PT/INR determinations at 14-wk intervals depending on patient's response; periodic
            urinalyses, stool guaiac, and liver function tests. Blood samples should be drawn at 1218 h after last dose (optimum).
         </li>
<li>Monitor closely older adult, psychotic, or alcoholic patients because they present serious noncompliance problems.</li>
<li>
            							Note: Patients at greatest risk of hemorrhage include those whose PT/INR are difficult to regulate, who have an aortic valve prosthesis,
            who are receiving long-term anticoagulant therapy, and older adult and debilitated patients.

<li>Understand that bleeding can occur even though PT/INR are within therapeutic range. Stop drug and notify physician immediately
            if bleeding or signs of bleeding appear: Blood in urine, bright red or black tarry stools, vomiting of blood, bleeding with
            tooth brushing, blue or purple spots on skin or mucous membrane, round pinpoint purplish red spots (often occur in ankle areas),
            nosebleed, bloody sputum; chest pain; abdominal or lumbar pain or swelling, profuse menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain; severe
            or continuous headache, faintness or dizziness; prolonged oozing from any minor injury (e.g., nicks from shaving).
         </li>
<li>Stop drug and report immediately any symptoms of hepatitis (dark urine, itchy skin, jaundice, abdominal pain, light stools)
            or hypersensitivity reaction (see Appendix F).
         </li>
<li>Avoid brand interchange, take drug at same time each day, and do <small>NOT</small> alter dose.
         </li>
<li>Notify physician if there is an unusual increase in menstrual bleeding (slightly increased or prolonged). Note: PT/INR are
            checked at least monthly in menstruating women.
         </li>
<li>Risk of bleeding is increased for up to 1 mo after receiving the influenza vaccine.</li>
<li>Fever, prolonged hot weather, malnutrition, and diarrhea lengthen PT/INR (enhanced anticoagulant effect).</li>
<li>A high-fat diet, sudden increase in vitamin Krich foods (cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, asparagus, lettuce, turnip
            greens, onions, spinach, kale, fish, liver), coffee or green tea (caffeine), or by tube feedings with high vitamin K content
            shorten PT/INR.
         </li>
<li>Maintain a well-balanced diet and avoid excess intake of alcohol.</li>
<li>Inform dentist or any new physician about anticoagulant therapy and duration of treatment.</li>
<li>Use a soft toothbrush and floss teeth gently with waxed floss.</li>
<li>Use barrier contraceptive measures; if you become pregnant while on anticoagulant therapy the fetus is at great potential
            risk of congenital malformations.
         </li>
<li>Do not take any other prescription or OTC drug unless specifically approved by physician or pharmacist. Carry medical identification
            at all times. It needs to indicate medical diagnosis, medication(s), physician's name, address, and telephone number.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
