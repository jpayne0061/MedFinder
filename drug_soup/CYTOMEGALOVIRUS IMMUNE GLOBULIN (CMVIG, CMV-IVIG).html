<p>Cytomegalovirus immune globulin (CMVIG) is a preparation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies derived from a large number
         of healthy donors with high concentrations of antibodies directed against cytomegalovirus (CMV).
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>The CMV antibodies attenuate or reduce the incidence of serious CMV disease, such as CMV-associated pneumonia, CMV-associated
         hepatitis, and concomitant fungi and parasitic superinfections.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Attenuation of primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease associated with kidney transplantation.</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Prevention of CMV disease in other organ transplants (especially heart) when the recipient is seronegative for CMV and the
         donor is seropositive.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>History of previous severe reactions associated with CMVIG or other human immunoglobulin preparations, selective immunoglobulin
         A (IgA) deficiency; lactation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>

<td><span class="ivtitle">Intravenous</span><ul>
<li>CMVIG should be administered through a separate IV line using an infusion pump. See manufacturer's directions if this is not
                     possible.
                  </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="routemethod">PREPARE:</span> <span class="methodtype">IV Infusion:</span>  Use a double ended transfer needle or large syringe to reconstitute with 50 mL sterile water. Gently rotate vial to dissolve;
                  do not shake. Allow 30 min to dissolve powder. Reconstituted solution contains 50 mg/mL. Must be completely infused within
                  12 h since solution contains no preservative.  
               </p>
<p><span class="routemethod">ADMINISTER:</span> <span class="methodtype"> IV Infusion:</span>  Use a constant infusion pump and give at rate of 15, 30, 60 mg/kg/h over first 30 min, second 30 min, third 30 min, respectively.
                  Monitor closely during and after each rate change. If flushing, nausea, back pain, fever, or chills develops, slow or temporarily
                  discontinue infusion. If BP begins to decrease, stop infusion and institute emergency measures.  <span class="methodtype"> Infusion of subsequent IV doses:</span> The intervals for increasing the dose from 15 to 30 to 60 mg may be shortened from 30 to 15 min. Never infuse more than 75
                  mL/h CMVIG.  
               </p>
<ul>
<li>Reconstituted solution should be started within 6 h and completed within 12 h of preparation. Discard solution if cloudy.</li>
