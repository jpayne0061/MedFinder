<ul>
<li>Supervise ambulation. Initially, the loss of spasticity induced by baclofen may affect patient's ability to stand or walk.</li>
<li>Lab tests: baseline and periodic BP, weight, blood sugar, hepatic function tests, and urine.</li>
<li>Monitor for adverse neuropsychiatric or genitourinary symptoms that resemble those of the underlying disease. Assess them
            carefully and report to the physician.
         </li>
<li>Observe carefully for side effects: mental confusion, depression, hallucinations. Older adults are especially sensitive to
            this drug.
         </li>
<li>Monitor patients with epilepsy closely for possible loss of seizure control.</li>

            							Note: CNS depressant effects will be additive to other CNS depressants, including alcohol.
            						
         </li>
<li>Monitor blood glucose for loss of glycemic control if diabetic.</li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until the response to drug is known.</li>
<li>Report adverse reactions to physician. Most can be reduced by decreasing dosage. Incidence of CNS symptoms (drowsiness, dizziness,
            ataxia) are reportedly high in patients &gt;40 y of age.
         </li>
<li>Do not self-dose with OTC drugs without physician's approval.</li>
<li>Do not stop this drug unless directed to do so by physician. Drug withdrawal needs to be accomplished gradually over a period
            of 2 wk or more. Abrupt withdrawal following prolonged administration may cause anxiety, agitated behavior, auditory and visual
            hallucinations, severe tachycardia, acute exacerbation of spasticity, and seizures.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
