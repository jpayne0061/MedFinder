<p>1 g, 2 g injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Semisynthetic third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. Preferentially binds to one or more of the penicillin-binding proteins
         (PBP) located on cell walls of susceptible organisms. This inhibits third and final stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis,
         thus killing the bacterium. Spectrum of activity is similar to that of cefotaxime.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Generally active against a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria, including some strains of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Also active against some organisms resistant to first and second generation cephalosporins and currently available aminoglycoside
         antibiotics and penicillins: e.g., <i>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,</i> and <i>Serratia marcescens</i>. Other susceptible organisms include <i>Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, Shigella, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae,</i> groups A and B <i>Streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus,</i> and some strains of <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. Cefoperazone inhibits some strains of <i>Clostridium,</i> but <i>C. difficle</i> is resistant to the drug, as is <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>. It has a broad antibacterial spectrum, including gram-positive bacteria and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Effectively treats biliary tract infections, gynecologic infections and gonorrhea, intra-abdominal and soft tissue infections,
         respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, skin infections, septicemia, and surgical infections, reducing or
         eliminating signs and symptoms of infection.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Infections of skin and skin structures, urinary tract, respiratory tract; peritonitis and other intra-abdominal infections,
         pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis and other infections of the female genital tract; bacterial septicemia.
      </p>

<ul>
<li>Determine hypersensitivity to cephalosporins, penicillins, and other drug allergies before therapy begins.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Perform culture and sensitivity studies before initiation of therapy and during therapy, as indicated. Therapy
            may begin pending test results. Perform PTT and PT/INR before and during therapy.
         </li>
<li>Observe for and question patient about signs of hemostatic defects: wound bleeding (e.g., surgical patient), nose bleeds,
            bleeding gums, bloody sputum, hematuria. Hypoprothrombinemia and vitamin K deficiency are possible complications of therapy
            and can result in significant blood loss in some patients. Patients at risk are those with poor nutritional states, malabsorption
            problems, patients on hyperalimentation regimens, and alcoholism. Vitamin K supplements may be prescribed for these patients,
            if indicated.
         </li>
<li>Report the onset of loose stools or diarrhea. Most patients respond to replacement of fluids, electrolytes, and proteins.
            Discontinuation of drug may be required for some patients.
         </li>
<li>Monitor cefoperazone serum levels (at steady state: 150 mg/mL) in patients with hepatic disease or biliary obstruction who
            are receiving over 4 g/d, patients with both hepatic and renal disease receiving over 12 g/d, and patients with renal
            impairment on high dose therapy.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not ingest alcohol within 72 h after drug administration as this will cause a disulfiram-like reaction (see Signs &amp; Symptoms,
            Appendix F). Effects generally appear within 1530 min after alcohol is taken and disappear spontaneously 12 h
            later.
         </li>
<li>Report promptly any signs or symptoms of superinfection (see Appendix F).</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
