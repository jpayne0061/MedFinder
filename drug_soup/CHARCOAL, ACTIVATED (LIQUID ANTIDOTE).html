<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Residue from destructive distillation of organic materials treated to reduce particle size, which increases surface area and
         adsorptive power. Activated charcoal (carbon) is a chemically inert, odorless, tasteless, fine black powder with wide spectrum
         of adsorptive activity. Acts by binding (adsorbing) toxic substances, thereby inhibiting their GI absorption, enterohepatic
         circulation, and thus bioavailability.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Recent studies indicate that administration by "gastric dialysis" (repetitive doses) effectively increases clearance
         of drugs already absorbed into the systemic circulation. Action appears to result from increased rate of drug diffusion from
         plasma into GI tract where it is adsorbed by activated charcoal. Effectively adsorbs toxins in the gut preventing their systemic
         absorption and impact.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>General purpose emergency antidote in the treatment of poisonings by most drugs and chemicals, e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin,
         atropine, barbiturates, digitalis glycosides, phenytoin, propoxyphene, strychnine, tricyclic antidepressants, among many others.
         Gastric dialysis (repetitive doses) in uremia to adsorb various waste products from GI tract; severe acute poisoning. Has
         been used to adsorb intestinal gases in treatment of dyspepsia, flatulence, and distension (value in these conditions not
         established). Sometimes used topically as a deodorant for foul-smelling wounds and ulcers.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Reportedly not effective for poisonings by cyanide, mineral acids, caustic alkalis, organic solvents, iron, ethanol, methanol.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Pregnancy (category C); lactation.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Activated charcoal tablets or capsules are less adsorptive and thus less effective than powder or liquid form; therefore,
            they are not recommended in treatment of acute poisoning.
         </li>
<li>Drug is most effective when administered as soon as possible after acute poisoning (preferably within 30 min).</li>
<li>In an emergency, dose may be approximated by stirring sufficient activated charcoal into tap water to make a slurry the consistency
            of soup (about 2030 g in at least 240 mL of water).
         </li>
<li>Activated charcoal can be swallowed or given through a nasogastric tube. If administered too rapidly, patient may vomit.</li>
<li>If necessary, palatability may be improved by adding a small amount of concentrated fruit juice or chocolate powder to the
            slurry. Reportedly, these agents do not appreciably alter adsorptive activity.
         </li>
<li>To prevent adsorption of gases from the air, store in tightly covered container.</li>
