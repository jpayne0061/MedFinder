<p>Beractant is a sterile nonpyrogenic pulmonary surfactant. Endogenous pulmonary surfactant lowers surface tension on alveolar
         surfaces during respiration and stabilizes the alveoli against collapse at resting pressures. Deficiency of surfactant causes
         respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants.
      </p>

<p>Beractant lowers minimum surface tension and restores pulmonary compliance and oxygenation in premature infants.</p>

<li>Place refrigerated drug at room temperature for at least 20 min or warm in the hand for at least 8 min. Do not use artificial
            warming methods.
         </li>
<li>Give to premature infants weighing less than 1250 g, or who have a surfactant deficiency, preferably within 15 min of birth.</li>
<li>Give to infants requiring mechanical ventilation and with RDS confirmed by x-ray examination, within 8 h of birth.</li>
<li>Suction infant before administration of beractant.</li>
<li>
            				Note: Drug color should be white to light brown. If drug has settled, swirl vial gently to suspend.
            			
         </li>
<li>Administer using a No. 5 French end-hole catheter inserted into the endotracheal tube.</li>
<li>Follow specific dosing procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Carefully read and follow exactly accompanying drug administration
            literature.
         </li>
<li>Do not suction for 1 h after drug is administered unless signs of significant airway obstruction occur.</li>
<li>Unopened vials warmed to room temperature will not lose potency if refrigerated within 8 h of warming. Drug should not be
            warmed and returned to refrigerator more than once.
         </li>
<li>
            				Note: Vials are for single use only. Discard unused drug in opened vials.
            			
         </li>
<li>Store unopened vials inside carton to protect from light and refrigerated at 2°8° C (36°46°
            F) until ready to use.
         </li>

<ul>
<li>Monitor heart rate, color, chest expansion, facial expressions, oximeter, and endotracheal tube patency and position, during
            administration. Most adverse effects occur during dosing.
         </li>
<li>Monitor frequently with arterial or transcutaneous measurement of systemic oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub>.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Rales and moist breath sounds may occur transiently following drug administration. These do not necessarily indicate a need
            for suctioning.
