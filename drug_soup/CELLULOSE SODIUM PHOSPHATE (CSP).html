<p>2.5 g/packet;  300 g bottle</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>When taken with meals, releases sodium in exchange for bivalent cations (e.g., dietary and secreted calcium and magnesium)
         in intestines to form a nonabsorbable complex. Binding of these bivalent ions renders them unavailable for complexing with
         oxalate; thus formation of renal calculi is inhibited. Does not generally cause significant alterations in serum phosphate
         or calcium in most patients. Serum magnesium is predictably reduced, however, and therefore supplementation is necessary.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>It binds dietary and secreted calcium, interfering with its absorption in the gut, effectively lowering urinary calcium excretion
         and causing fecal excretion of calcium. Effectively treats nephrolithiasis by lowering calcium absorption in patients with
         Type I absorptive hypercalciuria.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjunct to dietary restriction to reduce renal calculi formation in absorptive hypercalciuria type I with recurrent calcium
         oxalate and calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Adjunct in treatment of hypercalcemia (e.g., associated with parathyroid carcinoma or sarcoidosis) and in management of calcinosis
         cutis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Bone disease, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperoxaluria; primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism, including renal hypercalciuria;
         high fasting urinary calcium or hypophosphatemia; conditions associated with high skeletal mobilization of calcium; pregnancy
         (category C), lactation. Safe use in children 
      </p><h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Sodium restriction, CHF, ascites, nephrotic syndrome.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Powder can be mixed with full glass (240 mL) of water, soft drink, or fruit juice and taken with meals. CSP is not palatable.</li>
<li>Oral magnesium supplement (e.g., magnesium gluconate) should be administered to prevent hypomagnesemia. It can be given at
            any time as long as it is at least 1 h before or after CSP to avoid binding of magnesium.
         </li>
<li>Doses of oral magnesium supplement depend on dose of CSP. Patients receiving 15 g/d of CSP should take 1.5 g magnesium gluconate
            before breakfast and again at bedtime (separately from CSP). Patients taking 10 g/d of CSP should take 1 g magnesium gluconate
            twice a day.
         </li>
<li>Store in tightly closed container protected from moisture, unless otherwise directed.</li>

<ul>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O rates and pattern: Fluid intake should be encouraged to maintain a urinary output of at least 2 L/d (approximately
            240 mL/h while awake).
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Evaluate serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels at least once between first 2 wk3 mo of therapy, and then
            every 36 mo during therapy. Serum and urinary calcium and oxalate, serum magnesium, copper, iron, and zinc, and CBC
            should be monitored every 36 mo throughout therapy.
         </li>
<li>Monitor urinary calcium levels. A reduction of less than 30 mg/5 g in urinary calcium in patients on moderate calcium and
            sodium restriction indicates treatment failure. Drug is usually discontinued.
         </li>
<li>Discontinuation of therapy is also indicated in patients on moderate oxalate restriction with urinary oxalate levels in excess
            of 55 mg/d. A rise in serum PTH above normal also points to the need to adjust dosage or stop the drug.
         </li>
<li>To increase therapeutic effectiveness of CSP, dietary restriction of sodium, calcium, oxalate, and ascorbic acid is essential.
            Collaborate with physician and dietitian.
         </li>
<li>With long-term use, monitor for manifestations of hypomagnesemia (see Signs &amp; Symptoms, Appendix F).</li>

<li>Take this drug with meals or at least within 30 min of a meal, otherwise it will not be effective.</li>
