<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>200 mg, 400 mg tablets; 100 mg/5 mL suspension</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>A third-generation cephalosporin that is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamases (penicillinases and cephalosporinases)
         and therefore has excellent activity against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria. It is bactericidal against susceptible
         bacteria. Cephalosporins inhibit mucopeptide synthesis in the bacterial cell wall.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Effectively treats respiratory tract, urinary tract infection, otitis media and gonorrhea, reducing or eliminating signs and
         symptoms of infection.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Effective against <i>Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,</i> and gram-negative bacilli, including <i>Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis,</i> and <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>. Little activity against <i>Staphylococci,</i> and no activity against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa;</i> also uncomplicated UTI, otitis media, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and bronchitis.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Patients with known allergy to the cephalosporin group of antibiotics.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Allergy to penicillin, history of colitis, renal insufficiency, pregnancy (category B), lactation. Safety and effectiveness
         in infants

<ul>
<li>Determine previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, and history of other allergies, particularly
            to drugs prior to initiation of therapy.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Perform culture and sensitivity tests prior to initiation of therapy and periodically during therapy. Therapy may
            be implemented pending test results.
         </li>
<li>Discontinue if seizures associated with the drug therapy occur.</li>
<li>Monitor for superinfections (see Appendix F) caused by overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, particularly during prolonged
            use.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O rates and pattern: Nephrotoxicity occurs more frequently in patients &gt;50 y, with impaired renal function, in the
            debilitated, and in patients receiving high doses or other nephrotoxic drugs.
         </li>
<li>Carefully monitor anyone with a history of allergies, especially to drugs. Report manifestations of hypersensitivity (see
            Appendix F).
         </li>
<li>Promptly report loose stools or diarrhea, which may indicate pseudomembranous colitis (see Appendix F). Discontinuation of
            drug may be necessary.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report loose stools or diarrhea during drug therapy and for several weeks after. Older adult patients are especially susceptible
            to pseudomembranous colitis.
         </li>
<li>Take this antibiotic for the full course of treatment.</li>
<li>Do not miss any doses and take the doses at evenly spaced times, day and night.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
