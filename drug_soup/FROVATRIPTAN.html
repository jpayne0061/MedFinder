<p>2.5 mg tablets</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Selective agonist that binds with high affinity to 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> serotonin receptors which are found on extracerebral and intracranial blood vessels, and on other structures in the central
         nervous system.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Due primarily to agonist effects on 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> serotonin receptors on cranial blood vessels result in vasoconstriction and agonist effects on nerve terminals in the trigeminal
         system. Activation of these receptors results in constriction of cranial vessels which become dilated during a migraine attack,
         inhibition of neuropeptide release, and reduced signal transmission in the pain pathways.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Treatment of migraine headache with or without aura.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to frovatriptan; significant cardiovascular disease such as ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasms,
         peripheral vascular disease, history of cerebrovascular events, or uncontrolled hypertension; within 24 h of receiving another
         5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonist or an ergotamine-containing or ergot-type drug; basilar or hemiplegic migraine, pregnancy (category C).
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Significant risk factors for coronary artery disease unless a cardiac evaluation has been done; hypertension; risk factors
         for cerebrovascular accident; impaired liver or kidney function; lactation. Safety and efficacy in children are not established.

<ul>
<li>Monitor cardiovascular status carefully following first dose in patients at relatively high risk for coronary artery disease
            (e.g., postmenopausal women, men over 40 years old, persons with known CAD risk factors), or who have coronary artery vasospasms.
         </li>
<li>Report to physician immediately chest pain or tightness in chest or throat that is severe, or does not quickly resolve following
            a dose of frovatriptan.
         </li>
<li>Pain relief usually begins within 10 min of ingestion, with complete relief in approximately 65% of all patients within
            2 h.
         </li>
<li>Monitor BP, especially in those being treated for hypertension.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Review patient information leaflet provided by the manufacturer carefully.</li>
<li>Notify physician immediately if symptoms of severe angina (e.g., severe or persistent pain or tightness in chest, back, neck,
            or throat) or hypersensitivity (e.g., wheezing, facial swelling, skin rash, itching, or hives) occur.
         </li>
<li>Do not take any other serotonin receptor agonist (e.g., Imitrex, Maxalt, Zomig, Amerge) within 24 h of taking frovatriptan.</li>
<li>Advise physician of any drugs taken within 1 wk of beginning frovatriptan.</li>
<li>Check with physician regarding drug interactions before taking any new OTC or prescription drugs.</li>
<li>Report any other adverse effects (e.g., tingling, flushing, dizziness) at next physician visit.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
