<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>2.5 mg, 10 mg tablets; 2% solution</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Direct-acting vasodilator similar to other drugs of this class, but hypotensive effect is more pronounced. Appears to act
         by blocking calcium uptake through cell membrane. Reduces elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressures in supine and standing
         positions, by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Hypotensive action accompanied by reflex activation of sympathetic, vagal inhibitory, and renal homeostatic mechanisms; increased
         sympathetic stimulation also activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Net result is increased heart rate and cardiac
         output, sodium retention, and edema, which usually necessitates concomitant supportive drug therapy. Drug-induced hair growth
         with systemic minoxidil usually develops after 1 y of therapy: it is nonvirilizing, involving face and limbs of the female
         and generalized increase in body hair in men. Topical minoxidil reverses balding to some degree.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Treat severe hypertension that is symptomatic or associated with damage to target organs and is not manageable with maximum
         therapeutic doses of a diuretic plus two other antihypertensive drugs. Used with a diuretic to prevent fluid retention and
         a beta adrenergic blocking agent (e.g., propranolol) or an alpha-adrenergic agonist (e.g., clonidine or methyldopa) to prevent
         tachycardia. <i>(Topical)</i> to treat alopecia areata and male pattern alopecia.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Pheochro-mocytoma; acute MI, dissecting aortic aneurysm, valvular dysfunction, heart failure. Safety during pregnancy (category
         C) or lactation is not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Severe renal impairment; recent MI (within preceding month); coronary artery disease, chronic CHF.</p>

<ul>
<li>Take BP and apical pulse before administering medication and report significant changes. Consult physician for parameters.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Periodic serum electrolytes.</li>
<li>Do not stop drug abruptly. Abrupt reduction in BP can result in CVA and MI. Keep physician informed.</li>
<li>Monitor fluid and electrolyte balance closely throughout therapy. Sodium and water retention commonly occur. Consult physician
            regarding sodium restriction. Monitor potassium intake and serum potassium levels in patient on diuretic therapy.
         </li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O and daily weight. Report unusual changes in I&amp;O ratio or daily weight gain, greater than 1 kg (2 lb).</li>
<li>Observe patient daily for edema and auscultate lungs for rales. Be alert to signs and symptoms of CHF (see Appendix F).</li>
<li>Observe for symptoms of pericardial effusion or tamponade. Symptoms are similar to those of CHF, but additionally patient
            may have paradoxical pulse (normal inspiratory reduction in systolic BP may fall as much as 1020 mm Hg).
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn about usual pulse rate and count radial pulse for one full minute before taking drug. Report an increase of 20 or more
            bpm.
         </li>
<li>Notify physician promptly if the following S&amp;S appear: Increase of 20 or more bpm in resting pulse; breathing difficulty;
            dizziness; light-headedness; fainting; edema (tight shoes or rings, puffiness, pitting); weight gain, chest pain, arm or shoulder
            pain; easy bruising or bleeding.
         </li>
<li>Be aware of possibility of hypertrichosis: Elongation, thickening, and increased pigmentation of fine body hair, especially
            of face, arms, and back. Develops 39 wk after start of therapy and occurs in approximately 80% of patients; reversible
            within 16 mo after drug withdrawal.
         </li>
<li>Report any dermatologic adverse effects or any other adverse effect promptly to physician.</li>
<li>Schedule follow-up examinations for q46 mo.</li>
<li>Comply strictly with regular regimen; maximizes chance of at least some hair regrowth.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
