<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Darbepoetin is an erythropoiesis-stimulating protein closely related to erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is a primary growth
         factor for erythroid development. It is produced naturally in the kidney in response to hypoxia, and stimulates red blood
         cell production in the bone marrow.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Production of endogenous erythropoietin is impaired in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) resulting in anemia. Darbepoetin
         stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as endogenous erythropoietin.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Treatment of anemia in patients with chronic renal failure or chemotherapy-associated anemia, treatment of chemotherapy-induced
         anemia in nonmyeloid malignancies.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Patients with uncontrolled hypertension; hypersensitivity to darbepoetin, pregnancy (category C).</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Controlled hypertension, elevated hemoglobin, folic acid or vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiencies, infections, inflammatory or malignant processes, osteofibrosis, occult blood loss, hemolysis, severe aluminum
         toxicity, bone marrow fibrosis, chronic renal failure patients not on dialysis, lactation, hematologic diseases.

<ul>
<li>Control BP adequately prior to initiation of therapy and closely monitor and control during therapy. Report immediately S&amp;S
            of CHF, cardiac arrhythmias, or sepsis. Note that hypertension is an adverse effect that must be controlled.
         </li>
<li>Notify physician of a rapid rise in Hgb as dosage will need to be reduced because of risk of serious hypertension. Note that
            BP may rise during early therapy as Hgb increases.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for premonitory neurological symptoms (i.e., aura, and report their appearance promptly). The potential for seizures
            exists during periods of rapid Hgb increase (e.g., &gt;1.0 g/dL in any 2-wk period).
         </li>
<li>Monitor closely and report immediately S&amp;S of thrombotic events (e.g., MI, CVA, TIA), especially for patients with CRF.</li>
<li>Lab tests: At baseline and periodically thereafter, evaluate iron stores, including transferrin and serum ferritin; Hgb twice
            weekly until stabilized and maintenance dose is established, then weekly for at least 4 wk, and at regular intervals thereafter;
            CBC with differential and platelet count at regular interval; periodic BUN, creatinine, serum phosphorus, and serum potassium.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Adhere closely to antihypertensive drug regimen and dietary restrictions.</li>
<li>Monitor BP as directed by physician.</li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in other potentially hazardous activity during the first 90 d of therapy because of possible seizure
            activity.
         </li>
<li>Report any of the following to the physician: chest pain, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, severe or persistent
            headache, fever, muscle aches and pains, or nausea.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
