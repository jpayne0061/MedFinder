<h1><a name="avail">Availability</a></h1>
<p>2.5 mg, 5 mg tablets; 0.2 mg aerosol; 1 mg/mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Synthetic adrenergic stimulant with selective beta<sub>2</sub>- and negligible beta<sub>1</sub>-agonist (cardiac) activity. Exerts preferential effect on beta<sub>2</sub> receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, inhibits histamine release from mast cells, and increases ciliary motility.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Relieves bronchospasm in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and significantly increases vital capacity. Promotes
         relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, contraction of GI and urinary sphincters, increase in renin, pancreatic beta-cell secretion,
         and serum HDL-cholesterol concentration. Increases uterine relaxation (thereby preventing or abolishing high intrauterine
         pressure).
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Orally or subcutaneously as a bronchodilator in bronchial asthma and for reversible airway obstruction associated with bronchitis
         and emphysema.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>To delay delivery in preterm labor.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Known hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines; severe hypertension and coronary artery disease; tachycardia with digitalis
         intoxication; within 14 d of MAO inhibitor therapy; angle-closure glaucoma. Used only after evaluation of risk-benefit ratio
         in pregnancy (category B) and lactation.
      </p>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Assess vital signs: Baseline pulse and BP and before each dose. If significantly altered from baseline level, consult physician.
            Cardiovascular adverse effects are more apt to occur when drug is given by SC route or it is used by a patient with cardiac
            arrhythmia.
         </li>
<li>Most adverse effects are transient, however, rapid heart rate may persist for a relatively long time.</li>
<li>Be aware that onset and degree of effect and incidence and severity of adverse effects of SC formulation resemble those of
            epinephrine.
         </li>
<li>Aerosolized drug produces minimal cardiac stimulation or tremors.</li>
<li>Be aware that muscle tremor is a fairly common adverse effect that appears to subside with continued use.</li>
<li>Monitor for symptoms of hypoglycemia in neonates born of a mother who used terbutaline during pregnancy.</li>
<li>Monitor patient being treated for premature labor for CV S&amp;S for 12 h after drug is discontinued. Report tachycardia promptly.</li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O ratio. Fluid restriction may be necessary. Consult physician.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Adhere to established dosage regimen (i.e., do not change dose intervals or omit, increase, or decrease the dose).</li>
<li>Inhalator therapy: Review instructions for use of inhalator (included in the package).</li>
<li>Learn how to take your own pulse and the limits of change that indicate need to notify the physician.</li>
<li>Consult physician if breathing difficulty is not relieved or if it becomes worse within 30 min after an oral dose.</li>
<li>Keep appointments with physician for evaluation of continued drug effectiveness and clinical condition. Terbutaline appears
            to have a short clinical period for sustained effectiveness.
         </li>
<li>Consult physician if symptomatic relief wanes; tolerance can develop with chronic use. Usually, a substitute agent will be
            prescribed.
         </li>
<li>Do not self-dose this drug, particularly during long-term therapy. In the face of waning response, increasing the dose will
            not improve the clinical condition and may cause overdosage. Understand that decreasing relief with continued treatment indicates
            need for another bronchodilator, not an increase in dose.
         </li>
<li>Do not puncture container, use or store it near heat or open flame, or expose to temperatures above 49° C (120°
            F), which may cause bursting. Contents of the aerosol (inhalator) are under pressure.
         </li>
<li>Do not use any other aerosol bronchodilator while being treated with aerosol terbutaline. Do not self-medicate with an OTC
            aerosol.
         </li>
<li>Do not use OTC drugs without physician approval. Many cold and allergy remedies, for example, contain a sympathomimetic agent
            that when combined with terbutaline may cause harmful adverse effects.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking/using this drug.</li>
