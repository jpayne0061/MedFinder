<p>18 g/500 mL injection</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Sodium-free organic amine that acts as a proton acceptor in the body buffering system, thus preventing or correcting acidosis.
         As a weak base, it combines with hydrogen ions from carbonic, lactic, pyruvic, and other metabolic acids, and penetrates the
         cell membrane to combine with intracellular acid.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Acts as a weak osmotic diuretic increasing urine pH and excretion of fixed acids, CO<sub>2</sub>, and electrolytes. Used to correct or prevent metabolic acidosis. May be preferable to sodium bicarbonate in treatment of
         severe metabolic acidosis when sodium or CO<sub>2</sub> elimination is restricted.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>To prevent or correct metabolic acidosis associated with cardiac bypass surgery and cardiac arrest and to correct excess acidity
         of stored blood [preserved with acid citrate dextrose (CD)] and used in cardiac bypass surgery. (Stored blood has a pH range
         of 6.86.22.)
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>Metabolic acidosis of status asthmaticus and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Anuria, uremia; chronic respiratory acidosis; pregnancy (category C), children, neonates.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>

<li>Observe entry site carefully. Perivascular infiltration of the highly alkaline solution may lead to vasospasm, necrosis, and
                     tissue sloughing. Stop infusion if extravasation occurs.
                  </li>
<li>Treat extravasation with a procaine and hyaluronidase infiltration to reduce vasospasm and to dilute tromethamine remaining
                     in tissues. If necessary, local infiltration of an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent (e.g., phentolamine) into the area may
                     be ordered.

<ul>
<li>Watch for signs of hypoxia (see Appendix F). Hypoxia and hypoventilation may result from drug-induced reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> tension (a potent stimulus to breathing), particularly if respiratory acidosis is also present.
         </li>
<li>Drug-induced hypoxia is a particular risk when concomitant use of other respiratory depressants or with COPD or impaired kidney
            function.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Monitor blood pH, Pco<sub>2</sub>, Po<sub>2</sub>, bicarbonate, glucose, and electrolytes before, during, and after treatment. Dosage is controlled to raise blood pH to normal
            limits (arterial: 7.357.45) and to correct acidbase imbalance.
         </li>
<li>Monitor ECG and serum potassium if drug is given to patient with impaired kidney function (reduced drug elimination). Since
            hyperkalemia is often associated with metabolic acidosis, be alert to early signs (see Appendix F).
         </li>
<li>Be alert for overdose symptoms (from total drug or too rapid administration): Alkalosis, overhydration, prolonged hypoglycemia,
            solute overload.
         </li>
