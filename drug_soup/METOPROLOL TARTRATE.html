<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Beta-adrenergic blocking agent with preferential effect on beta<sub>1</sub> adrenoreceptors located primarily on cardiac muscle. At higher doses, metoprolol also inhibits beta<sub>2</sub> receptors located chiefly on bronchial and vascular musculature. Antihypertensive action may be due to competitive antagonism
         of catecholamines at cardiac adrenergic neuron sites, drug-induced reduction of sympathetic outflow to the periphery, and
         to suppression of renin activity.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Reduces heart rate and cardiac output at rest and during exercise; lowers both supine and standing BP, slows sinus rate and
         decreases myocardial automaticity. Antianginal effect is like that of propranolol.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Management of mild to severe hypertension (monotherapy or in combination with a thiazide or vasodilator or both); long-term
         treatment of angina pectoris and prophylactic management of stable angina pectoris reduce the risk of mortality after an MI.
      </p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>CHF.</p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Cardiogenic shock, sinus bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, overt cardiac failure, right ventricular failure
         secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Safety during pregnancy (category C), lactation, or in children is not established.
      </p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Impaired liver or kidney function; cardiomegaly, CHF controlled by digitalis and diuretics; AV conduction defects; bronchial
         asthma and other bronchospastic diseases; history of allergy; thyrotoxicosis; diabetes mellitus; peripheral vascular disease.

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Take apical pulse and BP before administering drug. Report to physician significant changes in rate, rhythm, or quality of
            pulse or variations in BP prior to administration.
         </li>
<li>Monitor BP, HR, and ECG carefully during IV administration.</li>
<li>Expect maximal effect on BP after 1 wk of therapy.</li>
<li>Take several BP readings close to the end of a 12 h dosing interval to evaluate adequacy of dosage for patients with hypertension,
            particularly in patients on twice daily doses. Some patients require doses 3 times a day to maintain satisfactory control.
         </li>
<li>Observe hypertensive patients with CHF closely for impending heart failure: Dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, night cough, edema,
            distended neck veins.
         </li>
<li>Lab tests: Obtain baseline and periodic evaluations of blood cell counts, blood glucose, liver and kidney function.</li>
<li>Monitor I&amp;O, daily weight; auscultate daily for pulmonary rales.</li>
<li>Withdraw drug if patient presents symptoms of mental depression because it can progress to catatonia. Possible symptoms of
            depression: disinterest in people, surroundings, food, personal hygiene; withdrawal, apathy, sadness, difficulty in concentrating,
            insomnia.
         </li>
<li>Monitor patients with thyrotoxicosis closely since drug masks signs of hyperthyroidism (see Appendix F). Abrupt withdrawal
            may precipitate thyroid storm.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to take radial pulse before each dose. Report to physician if pulse is slower than base rate (e.g., 60 bpm) or becomes
            irregular. Consult physician for parameters.
         </li>
<li>Reduce insomnia or increased dreaming by avoiding late evening doses.</li>
<li>Monitor blood glucose (diabetics) for loss of glycemic control. Drug may mask some symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g., BP and
            HR changes) and prolong hypoglycemia. Be alert to other possible signs of hypoglycemia not affected by metoprolol and report
            to physician if present: Sweating, fatigue, hunger, inability to concentrate.
         </li>
<li>Protect extremities from cold and do not smoke. Report cold, painful, or tender feet or hands or other symptoms of Raynaud's
            disease (intermittent pallor, cyanosis or redness, paresthesias). Physician may prescribe a vasodilator.
         </li>
<li>Report immediately to physician the onset of problems with vision.</li>
<li>Learn measures to relieve dry mouth; rinse mouth frequently with water, increase noncalorie liquid intake if inadequate, suck
            sugarless gum or hard candy.
         </li>
<li>Relieve eye dryness by using sterile artificial tears available OTC.</li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in potentially hazardous activities until response to drug is known.</li>
<li>Do not alter established dosage regimen; compliance is very important.</li>
<li>Reduce dosage reduced gradually over a period of 12 wk when drug is discontinued. Sudden withdrawal can result in increase
            in anginal attacks and MI in patients with angina pectoris and thyroid storm in patients with hyperthyroidism.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
