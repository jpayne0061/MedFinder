<p>325 mg/5 mL syrup; 1 g/mL solution</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Pharmacologic use primarily related to iodide portion of molecule. Exact mechanism not clear but believed to increase secretion
         of respiratory fluids by direct action on bronchial tissue, thereby decreasing mucus viscosity. If patient is euthyroid, excess
         iodide ions causes minimal change in thyroid gland mass. Conversely, when the thyroid gland is hyperplastic, excess iodide
         ions temporarily inhibits secretion of thyroid hormone, fosters accumulation in thyroid follicles, and decreases vascularity
         of gland.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Return of thyrotoxic symptoms may occur after 1014 d of continuous treatment; consequently potassium iodide administration
         for hyperthyroidism is limited to short-term therapy. As an expectorant, the iodine ion portion of the molecule increases
         mucous secretion formation in the bronchi, and decreases viscosity of the mucous.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>To facilitate bronchial drainage and cough in emphysema, asthma, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and respiratory tract
         allergies characterized by difficult-to-raise sputum. Also used alone for hyperthyroidism or in conjunction with antithyroid
         drugs and propranolol in treatment of thyrotoxic crisis; in immediate preoperative period for thyroidectomy to decrease vascularity,
         fragility, and size of thyroid gland and for treatment of persistent or recurring hyperthyroidism that occurs in Graves' disease
         patients. Used as a radiation protectant in patients receiving radioactive iodine and to shield the thyroid gland from radiation
         in the wake of a serious nuclear plant accident. (Use as an expectorant has been largely replaced by other agents.)
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to iodine; hyperthyroidism; hyperkalemia; acute bronchitis; pregnancy (category D), lactation.</p>
<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>
<p>Renal impairment; cardiac disease; pulmonary tuberculosis; Addison's disease.</p>

<h1><a name="admintn">Administration</a></h1><span class="adminroutetype">Oral</span><br/><ul>
<li>Give with meals in a full glass (240 mL) of water or fruit juice and at bedtime with food or juice to disguise salty taste
            and minimize gastric distress.
         </li>
<li>Avoid giving KI with milk; absorption of the drug may be decreased by dairy products.</li>
<li>Adhere strictly to schedule and accurate dose measurements when iodide is administered to prepare thyroid gland for surgery,
            particularly at end of treatment period when possibility of "escape" (from iodide) effect on thyroid gland increases.
         </li>
<li>Place container in warm water and gently agitating to dissolve if crystals are noted in the solution.</li>
<li>Discard any solution that has turned a brownish yellow on standing, especially if exposed to light (caused by liberated trace
            of free iodine).
         </li>
<li>Store in airtight, light-resistant container.</li>

<p><span class="adeffecttitle">Assessment &amp; Drug Effects</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lab tests: Determine serum potassium levels before and periodically during therapy.</li>
<li>Keep physician informed about characteristics of sputum: quantity, consistency, color.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Report to physician promptly the occurrence of GI bleeding, abdominal pain, distension, nausea, or vomiting.</li>
<li>Report clinical S&amp;S of iodism (see <small>ADVERSE EFFECTS</small>). Usually, symptoms will subside with dose reduction and lengthened intervals between doses.
         </li>
<li>Avoid foods rich in iodine if iodism develops: Seafood, fish liver oils, and iodized salt.</li>
<li>Be aware that sudden withdrawal following prolonged use may precipitate thyroid storm.</li>
<li>Do not use OTC drugs without consulting physician. Many preparations contain iodides and could augment prescribed dose [e.g.,
            cough syrups, gargles, asthma medication, salt substitutes, cod liver oil, multiple vitamins (often suspended in iodide solutions)].
         </li>
<li>Be aware that optimum hydration is the best expectorant when taking KI as an expectorant. Increase daily fluid intake.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
