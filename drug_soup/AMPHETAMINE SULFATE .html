<p>5 mg, 10 mg tablets; Adderall 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg tablets; 5 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 30 mg sustained release capsules</p>
<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Indirect-acting synthetic sympathomimetic amine with peripheral alpha- and beta-adrenergic activity. Marked stimulant effect
         on CNS thought to be due to action on cerebral cortex and possibly the Reticular Activating System. Acts indirectly on adrenergic
         receptors by increasing synaptic release of norepinephrine and dopamine in brain and by blocking reuptake at presynaptic membranes.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>CNS stimulation results in increased motor activity, diminished sense of fatigue, alertness, wakefulness, and mood elevation.
         In hyperkinetic children, it exerts a paradoxic sedative effect by unclear mechanism. Anorexigenic effect thought to result
         from direct inhibition of hypothalamic appetite center, as well as mood elevation.
      </p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Narcolepsy, attention deficit disorder in children and adults (hyperkinetic behavioral syndrome, minimal brain dysfunction).
         Use as short-term adjunct to control exogenous obesity not generally recommended because of its potential for abuse.
      </p>
<h1><a name="contrain">Contraindications</a></h1>
<p>Hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines; history of drug abuse; severe agitation; hyperthyroidism; diabetes mellitus; moderate
         to severe hypertension, advanced arteriosclerosis, angina pectoris or other cardiovascular disorders; Gilles de la Tourette
         disorder; glaucoma; during or within 14 d after treatment with MAOIs. Safety during pregnancy (category C) or lactation is
         not established.

<h1><a name="precaution">Cautious Use</a></h1>

<ul>
<li>Monitor for therapeutic effectiveness. Tolerance to the mood-elevating effects commonly occurs within a few weeks. Drug is
            usually discontinued when tolerance develops. Generally, tolerance does not occur when used for attention deficit disorder
            or narcolepsy.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for S&amp;S of toxicity in children. Response to this drug is more variable in children than adults; acute toxicity has
            occurred over a wide range of dosage.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for S&amp;S of insomnia or anorexia. Report complaints to physician. Dosage reduction may be required.</li>
<li>Monitor diabetics closely for loss of glycemic control.</li>
<li>Monitor growth in children; drug may be discontinued periodically to allow for normal growth.</li>
<li>
            							Note: Drug's excitatory and euphoric effects are associated with a high abuse potential.
            						
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep physician informed of clinical response and persistent or bothersome adverse effects. This drug exerts a stimulating
            effect that masks fatigue; after exhilaration disappears, fatigue and depression are usually greater than before, and a longer
            period of rest is needed.
         </li>
<li>Report insomnia or undesired weight loss.</li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in potentially hazardous tasks until response to drug is known.</li>
<li>Rinse mouth frequently with clear water, especially after eating, to relieve mouth dryness; increase fluid intake, if allowed;
            chew sugarless gum or sourballs.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Meticulous oral hygiene is required because decreased saliva encourages demineralization of tooth surfaces and mucosal erosion.
            Use of a commercially available oral lubricant, such as Moi-Stir or Xero-Lube, can relieve soft tissue problems and reduce
            the potential of tooth decay.
            						
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: Appetite suppression usually lessens within a few weeks and appetite increases; dose increase is not indicated.
            						
         </li>
<li>Avoid caffeine-containing beverages because caffeine increases amphetamine effects.</li>
<li>Note that drug is usually tapered gradually following prolonged administration of high doses. Abrupt withdrawal may result
            in lethargy, profound depression, or other psychotic manifestations that may persist for several weeks.
         </li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
