<p>Glycoprotein that stimulates RBC production. Hypoxia and anemia generally increase the production of erythropoietin.</p>

<p>Produced in the kidney and stimulates bone marrow production of RBCs (erythropoiesis).</p>
<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>

         other anemias related to malignancies and AIDS. Autologous blood donations for anticipated transfusions. Reduces need for
         blood in anemic surgical patients.

<ul>
<li>Control BP adequately prior to initiation of therapy and closely monitor and control during therapy. Hypertension is an adverse
            effect that must be controlled.
         </li>
<li>Be aware that BP may rise during early therapy as the Hct increases. Notify physician of a rapid rise in Hct (&gt;4 points in
            2 wk). Dosage will need to be reduced because of risk of serious hypertension.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with CRF during period of increasing Hct.</li>
<li>Monitor for premonitory neurological symptoms (i.e., aura, and report their appearance promptly). The potential for seizures
            exists during periods of rapid Hct increase (&gt;4 points in 2 wk).
         </li>
<li>Monitor closely for thrombotic events (e.g., MI, CVA, TIA), especially for patients with CRF.</li>
<li>Lab tests: Baseline transferrin and serum ferritin. Monitor aPTT &amp; INR closely. Patients may require additional heparin during
            dialysis to prevent clotting of the vascular access or artificial kidney. Determine Hct twice weekly until it is stabilized
            in the target range (3033%) and the maintenance dose of epoetin alfa has been determined; then monitor at regular
            intervals. Perform CBC with differential and platelet count regularly. Monitor BUN, creatinine, phosphorus, and potassium
            regularly.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Important to comply with antihypertensive medication and dietary restrictions.</li>
<li>Do not drive or engage in other potentially hazardous activity during the first 90 d of therapy because of possible seizure
            activity.
         </li>
<li>
            							Note: As Hct increases, there is an improved sense of well-being and quality of life. It is important to continue compliance with
            dietary and dialysis prescriptions.
            						
         </li>
<li>Understand that headache is a common adverse effect. Report if severe or persistent, may indicate developing hypertension.</li>
<li>Keep all follow-up appointments.</li>
<li>Do not breast feed while taking this drug without consulting physician.</li>
