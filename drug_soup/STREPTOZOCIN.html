<h1><a name="action">Actions</a></h1>
<p>Similar to other nitrosourea antineoplastics (e.g., carmustine) but with weaker alkylating effects. In general, this drug
         is highly toxic and has a low therapeutic index; thus a clinically effective response is likely to be accompanied by some
         evidence of toxicity. Inhibits DNA synthesis in both bacterial and mammalian cells and prevents progression of cells into
         mitosis, affecting all phases of the cell cycle (cell-cycle nonspecific). Appears to have minimal effects on RNA or protein
         synthesis. Delays repair of DNA damaged by nitrosourea-induced alkylation. Unlike other nitrosoureas, has markedly significant
         specificity for pancreatic beta and exocrine cells.
      </p>
<h1><a name="therapef">Therapeutic Effects</a></h1>
<p>Functional islet cell tumors produce and secrete a variety of hormones including glucagon, insulin, calcitonin, serotonin,
         and others. Successful therapy with streptozocin (alone or in combination) produces a biochemical response evidenced by decreased
         secretion of hormones as well as measurable tumor regression. Thus, serial fasting insulin levels during treatment indicate
         response to this drug.

<h1><a name="uses">Uses</a></h1>
<p>Metastatic functional and nonfunctional islet cell carcinoma of pancreas, as single agent or in combination with fluorouracil.</p>
<h1><a name="unlabeleduses">Unlabeled Uses</a></h1>
<p>A variety of other malignant neoplasms including metastatic carcinoid tumor or carcinoid syndrome, refractory advanced Hodgkin's
         disease, and metastatic colorectal cancer.

<li>Use only under constant supervision by physician experienced in therapy with cytotoxic agents and only when the benefit to
                     risk ratio is fully and thoroughly understood by patient and family.
                  </li>
<li>Wear gloves to protect against topical exposure, which may pose a carcinogen hazard, when handling streptozocin. If solution
                     or powder comes in contact with skin or mucosa, promptly flush the area thoroughly with soap and water.

<p><span class="routemethod">PREPARE:</span> <span class="methodtype">IV Infusion:</span> Reconstitute with 9.5 mL D5W or NS, to yield 100 mg/mL. Solution will be pale gold. May be further diluted with up to 250
                  mL of the original diluent. Protect reconstituted solution and vials of drug from light.

<p><span class="routemethod">ADMINISTER:</span> <span class="methodtype">IV Infusion:</span> Give over 1560 min. Inspect injection site frequently for signs of extravasation (patient complaints of stinging or
                  burning at site, swelling around site, no blood return or questionable blood return). If extravasation occurs, area requires
                  immediate attention to prevent necrosis. Remove needle, apply ice, and contact physician regarding further treatment to infiltrated
                  tissue.

<li>Lab tests: Perform CBC at least weekly, and liver function tests prior to each course of therapy. Dosage adjustment or discontinuation
            may be required if there is evidence of decreased liver or bone marrow function. Obtain serial urinalyses and determinations
            of BUN, creatinine clearance, and serum electrolytes prior to and weekly during therapy, then for 4 wk after termination of
            therapy.
         </li>
<li>Ensure that repeat courses of streptozocin treatment are not given until patient's liver, kidney, and hematologic functions
            are within acceptable limits. Platelet and leukocyte nadirs generally occur 12 wk after beginning therapy.
         </li>
<li>Report evidence of drug-induced declining kidney function promptly; changes are dose related and cumulative.</li>
<li>Be alert to early laboratory evidence of kidney dysfunction: Hypophosphatemia, mild proteinurea, and changes in I&amp;O ratio
            and pattern.
         </li>
<li>Mild adverse renal effects may be reversible following discontinuation of streptozocin, but nephrotoxicity may be irreversible,
            severe, or fatal.
         </li>
<li>Be alert to symptoms of sepsis and superinfections (leukopenia) or increased tendency to bleed (thrombocytopenia). Myelosuppression
            is severe in 1020% of patients and may be cumulative and more severe if patient has had prior exposure to radiation
            or to other antineoplastics.
         </li>
<li>Monitor for S&amp;S of superinfection (see Appendix F).</li>
<li>Monitor and record temperature pattern to promptly recognize impending sepsis.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="eductitle">Patient &amp; Family Education</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Inspect site at weekly intervals and report changes in tissue appearance if extravasation occurred during IV infusion.</li>
<li>Report symptoms of hypoglycemia (see Appendix F) even though this drug has minimal, if any, diabetogenic action.</li>
<li>Drink fluids liberally (20003000 mL/d). Hydration may protect against drug toxicity effects.</li>
<li>Report S&amp;S of nephrotoxicity (see Appendix F).</li>
<li>Do not take aspirin without consulting physician.</li>
<li>Report to physician promptly any signs of bleeding: Hematuria, epistaxis, ecchymoses, petechial.</li>
